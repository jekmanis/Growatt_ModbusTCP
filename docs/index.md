[![GitHub Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/0xAHA/Growatt_ModbusTCP.svg)](https://github.com/0xAHA/Growatt_ModbusTCP/issues)

A native Home Assistant integration for Growatt solar inverters using **direct Modbus RTU/TCP communication**. Real-time data straight from your inverter — no cloud, no ShineWiFi, no dependency on Growatt's servers.

---

## How It Works

![System Topology](images/system-topology.svg)

The integration polls your inverter directly over Modbus — the same protocol the inverter uses natively. A RS485-to-TCP or RS485-to-USB adapter bridges the inverter's serial port to your Home Assistant instance. No cloud account is required and no data leaves your home network.

## Setup

The setup wizard runs auto-detection automatically for VPP-capable inverters. For legacy models select the profile manually based on your inverter's power range.

| Parameter | TCP | Serial |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host / Device | IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.100`) | Path (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`) |
| Port / Baudrate | `502` | `9600` |
| Slave ID | `1` (usually) | `1` (usually) |

**Options (after setup):**

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device Name | "Growatt" | Prefix for all sensor names |
| Scan Interval | 30 s | Polling frequency (5–300 s) |
| Connection Timeout | 10 s | Response timeout (1–60 s) |
| Invert Grid Power | Auto | Fix a backwards CT clamp |
| USB / Serial Port | - | Change the adapter path without re-adding the entry |
| Host / TCP Port | - | Change the gateway address without re-adding the entry |

### Use a stable path for USB adapters

`/dev/ttyUSB0` is assigned in the order devices are enumerated. With more than one USB
serial adapter attached - an inverter and a battery BMS, say - a reboot can swap them, and
the integration then talks to the wrong device or fails to connect.

There are two stable alternatives, and the setup page lists both. Which one is right depends
on your adapter:

| Path | Keyed on | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| `/dev/serial/by-id/...` | the adapter's vendor, product and **serial number** | your adapter has a serial number - it then survives being moved to another socket |
| `/dev/serial/by-path/...` | the **physical USB socket** | your adapter has no serial number, or you have two identical adapters |

```
/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Single_Serial_58CA017290-if00
/dev/serial/by-path/pci-0000:00:14.0-usb-0:5:1.0-port0
```

**Check for a serial number before choosing by-id.** The first example above ends in
`58CA017290`, a real serial. A name like `usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0` has none - it
describes the chip model only. CH340 chips (USB vendor `1a86`), which most cheap RS485
adapters use, ship without serial numbers, so **two identical CH340 adapters cannot be told
apart by by-id** and you may end up pointing two config entries at the same one. Use
`by-path` for those.

If yours is not listed, run `ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/ /dev/serial/by-path/` on the host and
paste the path into the manual field.

## Device Structure

When you add the integration it creates **up to five devices** in Home Assistant, each grouping logically related sensors:

![Device Hierarchy](images/device-hierarchy.svg)

| Device | Always present? | Key entities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Inverter** | Yes | Status, inverter temp, fault code, firmware version |
| **Solar** | Yes | `pv1_power`, `solar_total_power`, `energy_today`, `energy_total` |
| **Grid** | Yes | `grid_export_power`, `grid_import_power`, `energy_to_grid_today` |
| **Load** | Yes | `house_consumption`, `power_to_load`, `load_energy_today` |
| **Battery** | Hybrid models only | `battery_soc`, `battery_power`, `charge_energy_today` |

> The Battery device is automatically created for hybrid and off-grid profiles. It does not appear for grid-tied-only models (MIC, MIN TL-X, MID).

## Power Flow & Sensor Glossary

Understanding which sensor measures what is the most common source of confusion. Here is how energy flows through the system and what each sensor represents.

![Power Flow](images/power-flow.svg)

| Sensor | What it measures | Sign / direction | HA Energy Dashboard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pv1_power` / `pv2_power` / `pv3_power` | Individual PV string output | Always ≥ 0 W | — |
| `solar_total_power` | Combined output of all PV strings | Always ≥ 0 W | — |
| `energy_today` | PV energy generated today | Always ≥ 0 kWh | Solar production |
| `energy_total` | PV energy generated lifetime | Always ≥ 0 kWh | Solar production |
| `grid_export_power` | Power currently being sent to grid | Always ≥ 0 W | Return to grid |
| `grid_import_power` | Power currently being drawn from grid | Always ≥ 0 W | Grid consumption |
| `power_to_grid` | Raw bidirectional grid register | **+ export / − import** | (use export/import above) |
| `power_to_user` | AC power at grid/load boundary (register) | Always ≥ 0 W | Load monitoring |
| `power_to_load` | AC output power at inverter terminals | Always ≥ 0 W | — |
| `house_consumption` | **Calculated** total house draw | Always ≥ 0 W | Individual consumption |
| `self_consumption` | Solar power used on-site (not exported) | Always ≥ 0 W | Efficiency tracking |
| `battery_power` | Battery charge/discharge power | **+ charging / − discharging** | Battery storage |
| `charge_power` | Battery charging power only | Always ≥ 0 W | — |
| `discharge_power` | Battery discharging power only | Always ≥ 0 W | — |
| `battery_soc` | State of charge | 0–100 % | Battery charge level |
| `charge_energy_today` | Energy delivered into battery today | Always ≥ 0 kWh | Battery in |
| `discharge_energy_today` | Energy delivered from battery today | Always ≥ 0 kWh | Battery out |
| `energy_to_grid_today` | Total energy exported to grid today | Always ≥ 0 kWh | Return to grid |
| `load_energy_today` | Total energy consumed by house today | Always ≥ 0 kWh | Individual consumption |

> **`house_consumption` vs `power_to_user`:** `power_to_user` is a raw hardware register. `house_consumption` is calculated: solar produced + grid imported − grid exported. Use `house_consumption` in the Energy Dashboard for accurate whole-home consumption.
>
> **`battery_power` sign:** Positive = charging, negative = discharging — consistent across all models. SPF off-grid inverters report the opposite polarity in hardware; the integration corrects this automatically.
>
> **`battery_current` on SPF:** Register 68 only measures current during AC/grid charging. During PV charging it correctly reads 0 — this is a hardware limitation. Use `battery_power` for monitoring.

## Energy Dashboard Setup

The integration pre-configures sensors with the correct `state_class` and `device_class` for the HA Energy Dashboard. Recommended mapping:

| Dashboard slot | Sensor |
| --- | --- |
| Solar production | `sensor.{name}_energy_total` |
| Return to grid | `sensor.{name}_energy_to_grid_today` *(use total variant)* |
| Grid consumption | `sensor.{name}_energy_to_user_today` *(use total variant)* |
| Individual consumption | `sensor.{name}_load_energy_today` *(use total variant)* |
| Battery in | `sensor.{name}_charge_energy_today` *(use total variant)* |
| Battery out | `sensor.{name}_discharge_energy_today` *(use total variant)* |

> If `Grid Power` reads the opposite sign to what your dashboard expects, toggle **Invert Grid Power** (Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → Configure). Growatt reports positive = export while most Home Assistant cards want positive = import, so having it **on is normal and common** — it is a display convention, not a fault. `Grid Export Power` / `Grid Import Power` are unaffected by it. See [Invert Grid Power](hardware/models.md#invert-grid-power).

---

## Night-time Behaviour

When the inverter powers down at night the integration detects the absence of valid register data and marks the inverter as offline. Sensors retain their last daytime values rather than dropping to zero or showing unavailable — preventing phantom energy spikes in the HA Energy Dashboard.

- Sensors remain **available** with last known values
- `last_successful_update` attribute shows when data was last confirmed fresh
- Lifetime energy totals are **persisted to HA storage** and restored across HA restarts

Sensors resume normal operation automatically when the inverter wakes at sunrise.

---

## "Last Updated" on Sensors

HA only marks a sensor's `last_updated` timestamp when the value actually changes. If a sensor shows "last updated 4 minutes ago" it means the value has been constant for 4 minutes — not that polling stopped. The integration is still polling every scan interval; the inverter is simply reporting the same value each time.
