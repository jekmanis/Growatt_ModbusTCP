## How Auto-Detection Works

When you add the integration, it attempts to identify your inverter automatically before asking you to choose a profile.

![Auto-Detection Flow](../images/auto-detection-flow.svg)

**Key points:**

- VPP-capable inverters (DTC present) are identified with high confidence
- Legacy inverters (no DTC) use model name probing — works for MIN, MIC, SPH families
- If auto-detection picks the wrong profile, delete and re-add the integration with manual selection
- The Universal Register Scanner (Developer Tools → Actions) shows the detection reasoning in its output

> **Off-Grid Protocol:** SPF inverters use registers 0–97 only. VPP registers are never attempted for these models.

> **Help us test!** If you have an untested model, run the Universal Register Scanner and open an issue with the CSV output.

## Smart Meter Requirement

Several sensors only populate if a **Growatt smart meter** (GOSS-W or SPM-S CT clamp) is physically installed between the inverter and the grid connection. Without a meter the inverter has no way to measure AC import/export directly — the sensors appear in Home Assistant but always read zero.

### Which sensors are affected

| Sensor group | Without meter | With meter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grid Export / Import Power | Always 0 W | Live reading |
| Power to Grid / Power to User (registers) | Always 0 W | Live reading |
| Energy to Grid Today / Total | Always 0 kWh | Accumulating |
| Load Energy Today / Total (register-based) | Always 0 kWh | Accumulating |

> **`house_consumption` is never affected.** It is a calculated sensor (`solar_total_power + grid_import_power − grid_export_power`) and always reflects actual consumption regardless of meter presence — it just falls back to being solar-only when grid readings are zero.

### Which models are affected

| Model | Meter required? |
| --- | --- |
| **MOD 6000-15000TL3-X** (grid-tied, no battery) | **Yes** — 3000+ register range returns all zeros without meter |
| **MOD 6000-15000TL3-XH** (hybrid) | Yes, for accurate grid registers; battery-side sensors unaffected |
| **SPH-TL3, SPH, MIN TL-XH, WIT** (hybrid) | Yes, for meter-based grid registers; calculated `house_consumption` always works |
| **MIC, MIN TL-X, MID** (grid-tied, no battery) | No — grid power is inferred from the inverter's own AC measurement |
| **SPF** (off-grid) | N/A — grid connection is AC input only, no export |

### What hardware to get

Growatt sell two compatible meters:

- **GOSS-W** — DIN-rail energy meter with RS485, suited for residential panels
- **SPM-S** — split-core CT clamp version, easier retrofitting without rewiring

The meter connects to the inverter's RS485 COM port (same bus as the Modbus adapter, or daisy-chained). Configuration is done via the Growatt inverter display or ShinePhone app — the integration does not configure the meter.

> If you are unsure whether a meter is installed, check the **Energy to Grid Today** sensor at a time when you know the inverter is actively exporting. If it remains at 0 kWh while solar generation is high and house consumption is low, a meter is not present or not configured.

## Power Flow Notes

### Grid-Tied Models (MIC, MIN TL-X, MID)

No battery and no direct load measurement register. Power flow values are **calculated**:

```text
house_consumption  = solar_total_power - grid_export_power + grid_import_power
self_consumption   = min(solar_total_power, house_consumption)
grid_export_power  = max(0,  power_to_grid)
grid_import_power  = max(0, -power_to_grid)
```

### Hybrid Models (SPH, TL-XH, MOD, WIT)

Both calculated and register-based values are available. Register-based sensors (`power_to_load`, `power_to_user`, `power_to_grid`) are read directly from the inverter and are generally more accurate.

**Battery power sign convention (all models):**

- **Positive** = Battery is charging
- **Negative** = Battery is discharging

> SPF off-grid inverters have hardware that reports the opposite polarity. The integration inverts this automatically — you always see the standard convention regardless of model.

---

## Invert Grid Power

> ⚠️ **v0.9.1b1 note:** A bug in the setup wizard's auto-detection caused **Invert Grid Power** to be incorrectly enabled for most users during initial configuration. If you set up the integration before v0.9.1b1 and your grid export/import sensors appear swapped after upgrading, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → Configure** and turn **Invert Grid Power off**. The vast majority of Growatt inverters do not need this option.

All models support an **Invert Grid Power** option. When enabled, the sign of the `Grid Power` sensor is flipped. This is only needed in the rare case where your inverter's registers report the opposite sign to the integration convention (positive = export).

**When to enable:** Only if `Grid Power` shows a positive value while you are definitely importing from the grid (or negative while definitely exporting), and `Grid Export Power` / `Grid Import Power` still look correct. This indicates the inverter itself reports the opposite sign convention.

**When NOT to enable:** Do not enable this to fix a swapped `Grid Export Power` / `Grid Import Power` display — those sensors derive directly from the physical register values and are independent of this setting since v0.9.1b1.

**How to change:** Integration → **Configure** → toggle **Invert Grid Power**.

## Manual Model Selection Guide

If auto-detection fails (or you want to override), choose based on:

1. **Phase:** Single-phase or three-phase grid connection?
2. **Battery:** Do you have battery storage connected?
3. **PV strings:** How many separate solar array strings are connected?
4. **Power range:** Inverter nameplate rating
