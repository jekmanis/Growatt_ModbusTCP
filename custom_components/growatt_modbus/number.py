        Some settings are conditional on another register rather than on the profile. The
        SPF's max charge current cannot be set while battery type is Lithium — the BMS takes
        over charge control — and this hardware discards a rejected save silently rather
        than refusing it, so an offered-but-ignored slider would look like it worked (#376).

        Declarative as `('field', value)` rather than a callable: a lambda here would be
        hard to test and easy to make decorative, which is a mistake this project has
        already shipped once.

        The second reason is a block that was not read at all this poll. Registers
