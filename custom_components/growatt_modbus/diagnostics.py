"""Diagnostics support for Growatt Modbus.

Surfaces a one-click state dump from the integration and device pages, so the
questions that dominate issue triage — which profile is selected, which version is
running, what the options are, whether the coordinator thinks it is online — can be
answered without a round trip.

This is deliberately NOT a replacement for the Universal Register Scanner service.
The two answer different questions:

  diagnostics (here)  What is the integration's current state?
                      Works even when every read is failing, which is exactly when
                      it is needed. Cannot see registers the profile does not define.

  register scanner    What does the hardware actually respond to?
                      Probes ranges outside the selected profile, offers decode
                      candidates per register, and reports per-register error text.
                      That is how 31059 (total PV power) and the TL-XH2 VPP-only
                      layout were found — neither is visible to diagnostics.

Ask for diagnostics first; ask for a scan when register discovery is needed.
