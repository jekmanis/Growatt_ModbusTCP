# Where udev puts the stable serial symlinks. Paths here are keyed on vendor, product and

# which is assigned in enumeration order and swaps between devices (#383).
SERIAL_BY_ID_DIR = "/dev/serial/by-id"

# The other stable form, keyed on the physical USB socket rather than the device. It is the
# right choice when the adapter has no serial number to key on — CH340 chips (USB vendor
# 1a86), which is most of the cheap RS485 adapters, ship without one. Two identical CH340s
# then produce by-id names that cannot distinguish them, so a user with two adapters can
# unknowingly point two config entries at the same one. by-path cannot be ambiguous: it
# names the socket the adapter is plugged into (#384).

    Lists the stable symlinks first and says why, because the alternative is a path that
    silently starts pointing at a different device. The reporter on #383 has a JK BMS on the
    same machine and loses the inverter whenever the two swap between ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1.

    Both stable forms are offered, because neither is right for everyone:

    - **by-id** follows the adapter, so it survives being moved to a different socket. It
      needs the adapter to have a serial number, and CH340s do not have one.
    - **by-path** follows the USB socket, so it is unambiguous even with two identical
      adapters, but changes if you replug into a different port.

    `current_path` is always included even when the device is absent right now. That is the
    whole point: this form exists to be used *after* a path has stopped working, and a
    `vol.In` whose default is not among its own options renders as an error rather than a
    form.
