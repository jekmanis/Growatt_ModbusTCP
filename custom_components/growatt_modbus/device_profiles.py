# `hasattr(data, 'battery_temp')`, and battery_temp is a GrowattData field with a 0.0
# default — so the attribute always exists and the gate can never fail. The sensor gets
# created regardless of whether any register populated it, and reports 0.0 °C.

# "dcdc_temp" to the shared TEMPERATURE_SENSORS group — which almost every profile
# includes. Only three register maps define the register at all, so every other model
# gained a "DC-DC Temperature" entity reporting 0.0 °C: a phantom created while fixing a
# phantom, verified on the two profiles that have the register and on none of the
# twenty-six that don't.
#
# Opt in per profile instead. A sensor group shared by everything is the wrong home for
# a sensor only a few models can populate, because adding to it is silent and the failure
# is invisible — nothing errors, an entity simply reports freezing forever.
