    # kept its own ModbusSerialClient and opened the same port a second time. A serial port
    # is exclusive, so every read then failed with
    #
    #     [Errno 11] Could not exclusively lock port /dev/ttyUSBn

    # taking every serial user offline, not only multi-entry ones (#384). Reverted in v1.7.5.
