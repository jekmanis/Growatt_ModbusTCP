"""Sensor integrity tests.

These tests verify that the sensor configuration is internally consistent
across sensor.py, const.py, and device_profiles.py — without importing any
Home Assistant modules.

Checks performed:
  1. Every sensor in SENSOR_DEFINITIONS is assigned to a device in SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP.
  2. Every sensor in a *_SENSORS group constant is defined in SENSOR_DEFINITIONS.
  3. SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP does not grow its undefined-sensor count beyond the
     explicitly tracked known-gap allowlist (KNOWN_MAP_WITHOUT_DEF).
