"""Actions that write fixed register addresses must refuse profiles that lack them.

Two of these shipped ungated. `set_battery_mode` was offered on a MIN TL-XH where its HOLD
mode charges the battery toward a stuck SOC limit - the opposite of standby - and imports
from the grid to do it (#400). `sync_tou_schedule` writes the VPP TOU block, which only the
two WIT maps carry, and was offered on every model (#396).

Both now check the profile and say what is missing. The check is on **register presence**
rather than on model family, because family checks are what produced the problem: MOD
carries the VPP control block and was excluded by a WIT-only gate (#373).
