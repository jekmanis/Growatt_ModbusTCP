"""SPF max total charge current, holding 34 (#376).

Two things this control has to get right, and both come from the reporter's own testing
rather than from the protocol document:

1. The range is **10-100 A**, from the SPF 6000ES Plus LCD manual (Program 02), not the
   0~400 in the family-wide off-grid protocol. The floor of 10 is the part that matters:
   this panel scrolls to 999 and then silently discards an out-of-range save, so a slider
   offering 0-9 would look accepted and change nothing.

2. It cannot be set at all when battery type is Lithium — "(If LI is selected in Program 5,
   this program can't be set up)". On hardware that discards rejected saves silently, a
   control offered in that state would appear to work. It is withheld instead.

The availability rule is tested through `control_is_blocked` rather than the entity, because
the entity needs Home Assistant and that suite only runs on Linux CI. The property is a
two-line call into this function, and a source check holds them together.
