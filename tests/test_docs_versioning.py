"""Version badges must read from the manifest, not be typed in.

A hardcoded badge is correct on the day it is written and wrong from the next release
onwards. Nothing catches it: the docs build succeeds, the tests pass, the page renders —
it just quietly advertises the wrong version to everyone who visits.

The documentation site badge sat at 0.9.8 while the integration shipped 1.5.0, which is
five minor versions of drift with no signal at any point.

shields.io can read `version` straight out of `manifest.json`, so the badge is always
right and there is nothing to remember at release time. This test stops a static one
being reintroduced.
