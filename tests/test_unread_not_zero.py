"""A register that could not be read must not be published as zero (#384).

The register cache is emptied at the start of every poll. When a block read failed its
addresses were simply absent, `_get_register_value` returned None, and the decode did
`or 0.0` - turning "I did not read this" into "the value is zero". The next poll recovered,
producing a one-sample vertical drop.

A reporter's solar graph showed exactly that: PV power falling to 0 W and returning to
~1450 W within one poll, with voltage and current dropping alongside it because all three
live in the same block. Nothing errored, because from Home Assistant's side the poll
succeeded.

Zero is not a neutral placeholder here. It is a plausible measurement that goes into
long-term statistics and cannot afterwards be told apart from a real one. An unknown state
leaves a gap, which is unambiguous about what happened.

This is the fifth appearance of the same root cause - see #360, #370, #374 and the residual
noted on #364.
