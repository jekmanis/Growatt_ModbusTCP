"""Setting the inverter's real-time clock (#393).

The inverter runs its own RTC and it drifts. That matters because time-of-use windows fire
against the *inverter's* clock, not Home Assistant's — a reporter's 13:00 export window
started two minutes late, and the drift was the reason.

Protocol V1.39 documents holding registers 45-51 as writable:

    45 Sys Year | 46 Sys Month | 47 Sys Day
    48 Sys Hour | 49 Sys Min   | 50 Sys Sec  | 51 Sys Weekly

Confirmed on hardware from two unrelated device classes before implementing:

* an SPH 3600 read 2026/8/22 14:08:19 with weekday 6, and 22 August 2026 was a Saturday —
  so the weekday field counts Monday as 1
* a GroHomeManager-X (DTC 82) on a different site read 2026/8/22 09:42:17 in the same
  registers

The year is the full four digits on both. The off-grid protocol uses the same addresses but
records "Year offset is 2000" and assigns register 51 to Chip Select, so writing this block
to an SPF would set the year wrong and clobber an unrelated register.
