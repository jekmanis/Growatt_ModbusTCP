"""Sensors dropped from a profile must be removed from the entity registry.

Removing a sensor from a profile's set stops it being created. It does not remove what
earlier versions already registered, so the entity stays in Home Assistant showing
`unavailable` — which reads as a broken sensor rather than one that was never meant to
exist, and is arguably worse than the wrong value it replaced.

This cleanup has now failed twice, each time differently:

  - v1.4.0 gated it on the inverter being reachable. `async_config_entry_first_refresh`
    seeds an empty `GrowattData()`, so the guard was never satisfied during setup and the
    block never ran at all (#362).
  - v1.5.3 dropped `dcdc_temp` from ~26 profiles, but the cleanup was a per-sensor block
    listing specific names, and the new removal never got one. The entities went
    unavailable instead of disappearing.

The fix for the second was a general rule: anything in SENSOR_DEFINITIONS that is not in
the profile's sensor set is stale, because sensor.py creates exactly the intersection of
those two and nothing else. These tests hold both properties.

Parsed from source: __init__.py imports Home Assistant, which the HA-free suite cannot
load.
