"""A multi-register control must hold the bus for its whole sequence (#331).

Some controls are not one register. The WIT VPP mode select writes six to eight — control
authority, AC charge enable, a TOU period, the period count, remote enable, the power
setpoint — and they only mean anything together.

Each write used to take the shared lock separately, from its own executor job, while a
poll holds that same lock for its entire duration. So a poll could land in the middle of
the sequence, and any single acquisition could time out after `SHARED_LOCK_TIMEOUT`,
leaving the inverter with control authority granted and no power setpoint, or a TOU period
with no count. Several branches `return` having already written 30100.

A half-applied VPP command is worse than one that plainly failed. It is also what drove a
user to bypass the integration and write an external MQTT proxy instead, reporting "locks
and timeouts and no usable shared connection".

Tested against the real `SharedModbusConnection` and a real `GrowattModbus` with a counting
fake, not by reading the source — the lesson of #374, where a test asserting a declaration
passed while the defect shipped.

    An earlier version of these tests counted acquisitions instead and asserted one per

    the count is N+1 while the bus is never actually released. Counting measured a proxy;
