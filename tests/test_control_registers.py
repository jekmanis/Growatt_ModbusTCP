"""Controls must be backed by a register, and scoped to the models that have it.

`WRITABLE_REGISTERS` (const.py) defines a control; a profile's `holding_registers` decides
whether it is offered. Nothing checked the two against each other — the sensor side has
`test_sensor_integrity.py`, the control side had nothing — so a control could name a
register no profile maps, or a profile could offer one its hardware rejects, and neither
showed up until a user wrote to it.

#371 is what that costs. MOD TL3-XH mapped 1090 and 1092 while the entire holding block
1000-1124 is unimplemented on that firmware: both reject writes with exception 2. Users
were shown two grid-charge switches, one of which silently did nothing.

#                                           Nothing read the flag, so the assertion was

#   test_the_wit_gate_still_confines_...    asserted the WIT gate still had its shape. It
#                                           did. But the gate only returns *inside* the
#                                           WIT branch — non-WIT profiles fall through to
#                                           the generic loop it was believed to confine.
#
# Both tested a declaration, or a mechanism believed to enforce it, rather than the
# outcome. v1.6.0 created five writable VPP controls on MOD with both passing, including a
# -100..+100% power slider on the register measured importing from the grid to reach its
