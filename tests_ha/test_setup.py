"""Setup and teardown tests.

These cover what I have been asking a user to confirm by hand after every release —
"does it load, does it reload" — which is the check that catches a broken `runtime_data`
migration or entity base class before anyone installs it.

v1.3.1 and v1.3.2 both shipped as pre-releases purely because I could not answer that
question locally.
