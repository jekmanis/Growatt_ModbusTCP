## Unreleased

Staged for the next release. **Not yet published** — v1.8.14 is the current stable.

- **Your inverter now tells you if it is on the wrong profile.** Detection ran once during
  setup and was never revisited, so a single timed-out read at that moment could leave an
  inverter on a profile that maps fewer registers than it supports - with nothing to say so.
  The device type code is now re-checked against a working connection, and a mismatch
  raises a repair notice suggesting the better profile. **Nothing is changed automatically.**
  Off-grid models are excluded from the check entirely, because reading those registers can
  power-cycle an SPF. (#405, #228)
- **WIT: battery power no longer reads ten times too high.** The scale is chosen at runtime
  by comparing the power register against voltage x current, and on some units several
  registers claim to be battery current while disagreeing wildly - one inverter offered
  -0.1 A, 6.3 A and -4.3 A at the same instant. The largest was used, the wrong scale
  matched it, and the choice stuck for the session, giving 40 kW readings on a 6.5 kW
  battery. When the current registers disagree, no scale is now inferred and the
  documented one is used. Reported by @sebastianries. (#406)
- **SPF: the impossible-PV-zero message no longer repeats in the log.** The suppression
  warns once per restart and logs further occurrences at debug. It stays a warning the first
  time, because knowing your inverter reports 0 W PV while producing over a kilowatt is
  worth one line - but the fault can recur on every poll, and it appears in Home Assistant's
  error log, so repeating it says the integration is broken rather than the inverter.
  Raised by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **A setting re-entered after it failed to apply is no longer skipped.** The check that
  avoids rewriting a register that already holds the requested value compared against
  cached data, up to a poll interval old. So if something else changed the register — the
  Growatt cloud, another controller — and you set it again to the value you wanted, the
  write could be dropped as redundant when it was not. It now reads the register first.
  Follow-up to #402.

---

## v1.8.14

Issues: #396 #401 #402

**Recommended for everyone.** Promotes v1.8.10-v1.8.13 to stable and adds two fixes that
protect your inverter's settings.

- **Writable settings are now numeric input boxes, not sliders.** Home Assistant writes on
  every step of a slider drag, so setting a battery voltage threshold wrote each value it
  passed through - one reporter aiming for 48.0 V left his inverter on 49.6 V, confirmed on
  the LCD. Enter the value and press Enter, and exactly one write is sent. Reported by
  @horiace. (#402)
- **A write is no longer repeated when the inverter is slow to commit.** The read-back
  check used to re-write on a mismatch, up to three times. On hardware that commits slowly
  it reads back the previous value, which is indistinguishable from a reversion, so ordinary
  writes were tripled. The write is now sent once and the register polled until it settles.
  These registers are likely EEPROM-backed, so this matters beyond the wrong values. (#402)
- **A daily energy counter dipping below zero no longer reads as 429,496,728 kWh.** Around
  the midnight reset the register can go briefly negative, and read as unsigned that became
  a spike large enough to flatten every other reading in your history. Such values are now
  withheld, leaving a short gap that recovers on the next poll. Applies to every 32-bit
  counter, not only the one reported. Reported by @gionci and @Vict20. (#401)
- **Sync TOU Schedule now refuses models it does not support**, instead of writing to
  registers that do not exist on them. It applies to WIT inverters only. (#396)
- Documentation: the clock sync guidance no longer suggests a drift threshold that would
  stop a weekly automation writing at all. (#393)

---

## v1.8.13 (pre-release)

Issues: #397

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.8.9 remains the stable release.

- **SPH 8000-10000TL-HU: battery current was reading ten times too high.** That profile
  declared a 0.1 A scale for the BMS current register where the other four SPH maps use
  0.01. The Growatt ESS Protocol - which V1.39 names as the reference for this whole
  register block - documents it in units of 10 mA, so 0.01 is correct. **Expect this sensor
  to drop by a factor of ten on upgrade**; the new value is the right one. No HU owner has
  measured it, so please report if it now looks wrong.
- Documentation: a new **ESS Protocol** page records the units, scales and bit meanings for
  the BMS block at registers 1082-1124, which V1.39 documents by name only. The source PDF
  is now checked in.

---

## v1.8.12 (pre-release)

Issues: #397 #398

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.8.9 remains the stable release.

- **Serial: the whole poll now holds the bus, not each transaction.** v1.8.10 stopped a read
  and a write running at the same instant but left the gap between register blocks open, so
  a write landing there ran its own connect/disconnect and closed the port out from under
  the poll. `[Errno 9] Bad file descriptor` and `[Errno 11] Could not exclusively lock port`
  both returned as soon as a reporter drove writes hard. Reported by @rinuskroon. (#398)
- **SPH: battery current now reads.** `SPH_3000_6000`, `SPH_7000_10000` and both V2.01
  variants had no register mapped for it at all, so the entity showed 0.00 A permanently
  while the BMS held a real value. Confirmed on an SPH3600 with a clamp DC ammeter -
  register 1088 read 1640 against a measured 16.4 A. Reported by @Vict20. (#397)

---

## v1.8.11 (pre-release)

Issues: #397 #399 #400

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.8.9 remains the stable release. Includes everything in
> v1.8.10.

- **PV3 and PV4 daily energy no longer vanish overnight.** Those two sensors were created
  only while their own value was above zero, so a restart during darkness left them absent
  until the first watt-hour of the morning, while PV1 and PV2 sat at 0.0 as normal. They
  now key off the lifetime counter, which still hides them on hardware that has no such
  string. Raised by @as-wallpen. (#399)
- **Set Battery Mode (VPP) now refuses models it does not support.** The action is written
  for WIT and WIS, and its HOLD mode depends on register behaviour those models have. On a
  MIN TL-XH it was offered anyway and HOLD charged the battery toward a stuck SOC limit -
  the opposite of standby - importing from the grid to do it. It now returns a clear error
  naming the missing registers. Reported by @GoncaloRibeiro11. (#400)
- **A write that is accepted but ignored now says what may have happened.** The warning
  named only a cloud override; some firmware silently discards out-of-range SOC limits,
  which sends people looking at the wrong thing. (#400)
- **Battery temperature is corrected on firmware that reports whole degrees.** One SPH3600
  reports 25 where the protocol specifies tenths, which showed as 2.5 C. The documented
  scale is unchanged and still used everywhere it is correct; the correction applies only
  to readings a working battery could not hold, and stops for good once a device proves it
  follows the spec. Reported by @Vict20. (#397)

---

## v1.8.10 (pre-release)

Issues: #395 #398

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.8.9 remains the stable release.

- **Legacy SPH profiles now read grid import and export energy.** `SPH_3000_6000` and
  `SPH_7000_10000` had no grid energy register mapped at all, so Import/Export Energy Today
  and Total had nothing behind them and published a value that never moved - one reporter
  saw a lifetime export of 0.1 kWh, another 3.4 kWh. The V2.01 variants of these profiles
  were unaffected. **Expect these four sensors to jump to their real values on upgrade.**
  Confirmed on an SPH 5000 against ShinePhone by @ian-mcarthur-oxford. (#395)
- **Serial connections no longer fail intermittently on concurrent read and write.** A
  coordinator poll and a control write could use the same serial client at once; when one
  reconnected after a timeout, the other was left with a closed handle and the write failed
  with `[Errno 9] Bad file descriptor` - about ten times a day for someone running TOU
  automations on a timer. Bus access is now serialised per client. Reported by
  @rinuskroon. (#398)
- This is a lock, not a return of the shared serial connection withdrawn in v1.7.5. Nothing
  opens the port twice; the client still owns its own socket.

---

## v1.8.9

Issues: #399 #393

**Update if you are on v1.8.6, v1.8.7 or v1.8.8.**

- **Conditional sensors were not being created.** Sensor setup aborted partway through, so
  every sensor whose creation depends on a value - PV energy totals, PV3 counters, Backup
  Box entities, and others by profile - was never created and read `unavailable` no matter
  how many times it was enabled, reloaded or restarted. Sensors without such a condition
  were unaffected, which is why the fault looked selective. Reported by @as-wallpen. (#399)
- **Automations triggering on an affected entity could not fire**, and nothing surfaced it:
  no repair, no log entry, no warning on the automation. Worth checking any automation that
  triggers on a Backup Box entity.
- Clock sync now compensates for its own write latency, so the inverter clock lands on the
  requested time rather than about 1.5 s behind it, and `drift_seconds` measures the
  inverter rather than partly measuring us. Reported by @Vict20. (#393)

---

## v1.8.8

Issues: #353 #361 #376 #377 #378 #379 #381 #383 #384 #385 #386 #389 #390 #392 #393

The first stable release since v1.6.2, consolidating 15 pre-releases.

## Read this before upgrading

Four changes are visible immediately. None needs action, but they will look like faults if they arrive unannounced.

**Sensors now go `unknown` instead of `0` when a read fails.** Previously a dropped Modbus frame published 0 for every register behind it, putting a vertical drop in the graph that could never afterwards be told apart from a real measurement. You will now see a gap instead. Genuine zeros are still recorded. This applies to every profile and to 69 sensors - solar, AC, grid, load, temperatures and every energy counter. If you have templates doing `| float` over these, check them.

**SPH: AC Charge Energy Total steps down.** It was reporting the battery charge counter, which includes solar - one reporter saw 13,820.7 kWh where the true grid-to-battery figure was 7,099.8 kWh. The new, lower value is the correct one and matches "EAC Total" on the Growatt app's raw device page.

**Three entities are removed automatically:**

| Entity | Why | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| SPH Warning Code | That register holds an energy value on these models, so it only ever reported 0 | - |
| AC Discharge Energy Total (grid-tied only) | No such register exists in the protocol for them; it could latch a stray reading permanently, in one case 21,069,824 kWh on a 12 kWh battery | Battery Discharge Total |

Off-grid models (SPF, SPE) genuinely have the discharge register and keep the sensor.

**SPH time-slot entities are renamed.** The Grid First slots showed as "Period 7/8/9" but are slots **1, 2 and 3** in the Growatt app and the protocol. Entity IDs are unchanged, so automations and dashboards keep working - only the displayed names move.

## New

### Inverter clock

The inverter runs its own RTC and it drifts. Time-of-use windows fire against **that** clock, not Home Assistant's, so a window set for 13:00 starts whenever the inverter believes it is 13:00. One SPH was two minutes out.

- **`growatt_modbus.sync_inverter_time`** sets it from Home Assistant's local time and returns the drift it corrected. `min_drift_seconds` skips the write when the clock is already close enough, so a scheduled automation costs nothing on the runs that find nothing to fix.
- **Inverter Clock** sensor - the inverter's time as readable local text, with `timestamp`, `drift_seconds` and `drift_minutes` attributes.
- **Inverter Clock Sync** button - the same write, on press.

Both entities are **disabled by default** and sit together under Diagnostic on the inverter device. The sensor adds one register read per poll and reads nothing at all until you enable it; the button writes six holding registers per press. Neither is offered on off-grid (SPF/SPE) profiles, where the year encoding differs and register 51 means something else.

Confirmed working on MIN TL-X. Requested and researched by @Vict20. (#393)

### Configuration

- **Connection settings can be changed after setup.** USB/serial port, baud rate, host and TCP port are editable from Configure. Previously the only route was deleting the entry, which loses entity IDs and with them automations, dashboards and statistics history. Requested by @dartyukh-afk. (#383)
- **A wrong protocol variant can be corrected without deleting the integration.** Ten inverter families exist as two register maps chosen by auto-detection, and a wrong choice was unrecoverable. Configure now has a **Protocol variant** field (Auto / Legacy V1.39 / VPP V2.01) and names the register map currently loaded. Leaving it on Auto changes nothing. (#385)
- **The serial port picker offers `/dev/serial/by-id/` and `/dev/serial/by-path/` paths**, labelled by what they follow. `by-id` needs the adapter to have a serial number, which CH340 chips - most cheap USB-RS485 adapters - do not have, so `by-path` is the right choice there. (#383, #384)

### Entities

- **SPF Bulk and Float Charge Voltage** controls, 48.0-58.4 V, on a self-defined battery type. Disabled by default: an in-range but wrong value affects your battery rather than a reading. Requested by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **SPF 3000-6000 ES Plus: Max Charge Current**, 10-100 A across solar and utility. Unavailable when Battery Type is Lithium, which the inverter does not allow. Reported by @dinkalin-ux. (#376)
- **SPH: AC Charge Energy Today**, from the corrected register block. (#390)
- **PV3 Energy Today and Total** on three-string systems. (#381)

---

## Fixes

### Data integrity

- **No sensor publishes a zero for a reading it could not take.** Derived values - total solar power, per-phase power calculated from voltage and current - inherit the read state of their inputs, so they go unknown too rather than quietly summing missing data. Battery charge and discharge power no longer both read 0 W on a failed read, which was indistinguishable from an idle battery. Reported by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **SPF: a PV reading of zero that the inverter's own registers contradict is reported as unknown.** Some SPF units intermittently report 0 in their PV registers while still producing - the read succeeds, the registers are simply wrong. One poll showed 1,907 W of AC output with 329 W from the battery, no grid and no generator, and PV reading zero. Only applies when every other supply reads zero and the shortfall exceeds 200 W, so night-time and battery-only readings are untouched. Reported by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **SPF battery direction is no longer thrown off by those false zeros.** The sign correction compares PV against load, and a false zero made it conclude the battery was discharging when it was charging.

### Register mappings

- **SPH 3-6kW and 7-10kW report battery charge and discharge energy.** These published a constant 0 because the registers were never mapped. Load consumption energy arrives at the same time. Reported by @igotyou, confirmed against ShinePhone. (#377)
- **SPH V2.01 profiles read battery energy on hardware without VPP support.** A V1.39 inverter on a V2.01 profile never reads the 31000 range, so Battery Charge/Discharge Today and Total sat at 0.0 while voltage and SOC worked. Reported by @igotyou. (#377)
- **Three-string MOD, MID and SPH 7-10kW no longer under-report daily solar.** PV3 had no energy counter, and the daily figure is the sum of the per-string counters - so a whole string was missing. On a MID 25KTL3-XH that was 17.6 kWh against the portal's 29.5. Reported by @as-wallpen, registers derived and confirmed with @KevlarD-67. (#381)
- **MIN TL-XH2 reports inverter temperature.** That model answers Illegal Function across the base register range, where every other profile reads it, so it had no temperature source. It now uses VPP register 31114. Reported by @Richardmarkink. (#361)
- SPH V2.01 profiles had registers 1052-1055 labelled as grid import, which is battery discharge energy. No entity changes. (#378)

### Writes

- **WIT grid charging works on models that reject Write Single Register.** Register 30410 accepts only FC 0x10 on some WIT hardware; the refusal was logged and stepped over, so every other register in the mode sequence succeeded and grid charging silently never engaged. It now falls back to FC 0x10, and reports a real failure when neither function code works. Reported by @jekmanis. (#353)
- **Setting a control to the value it already has no longer writes to the inverter.** These registers are believed to be EEPROM-backed with a finite write budget. A scheduler recomputing time slots on a timer was writing every slot on every run, including the ones already correct. Raised by @dinkalin-ux and @KevlarD-67. (#384, #392)
- **Every write failure reports the device's own reason** instead of "returned error". The Modbus exception code distinguishes a register that does not exist from a value that was rejected, and it was being discarded.

### Connection and diagnostics

- **A serial port that cannot be opened explains itself**, instead of a bare `Failed to connect` with the real reason buried in a pymodbus line above it.
- **The register scanner falls back to single-register reads when a gateway refuses blocks.** It read 125 registers per request and never tried smaller, so a bandwidth-limited bridge - LoRa gateways especially - produced a scan that looked like a dead device. Reported by @Henxidou001. (#389)
- **Register scans name the register map instead of reporting UNKNOWN.** Diagnostic output only. (#379)
- **Changing connection settings no longer logs a blocking-call warning.** Opening the options page on a serial setup enumerated ports on the event loop, which Home Assistant reports with a traceback asking you to file a bug. (#384)
- **SPF: routine battery-direction corrections no longer appear as errors.** In status 12 the SPF reports an unreliable sign, so direction is resolved from the power balance - normal operation that can fire a dozen times on a sunny day. It was logged at warning level, which put it in the error log under "originated from a custom integration". Now debug. Reported by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **Stopped using a device registry attribute Home Assistant deprecated in 2026.8**, which would otherwise write warnings naming this integration into your log.

---

## Documentation

- **PV Energy Total vs Energy Total on hybrids.** The two descriptions contradicted each other. On a hybrid, Energy Total counts battery discharge including energy the battery took from the grid, so it is normally the larger. Raised by @Vict20. (#381)
- **The EEPROM guidance is labelled as inference.** Growatt marks a few VPP registers "Not storage" and says nothing about the rest; treating the rest as non-volatile is our caution, not a documented limit. Raised by @KevlarD-67. (#392)
- **Choosing a stable serial path** - why `by-path` suits CH340 adapters and `/dev/ttyUSBn` numbering cannot be relied on.
- **New Actions Reference** covering all nine actions with YAML examples.
- Register 30476 (WIT priority mode) is no longer described as read-only; the TOU Default Mode control writes it. (#353)

---

## Note on v1.7.0-v1.7.4

Those pre-releases added a shared serial connection that broke serial polling and were withdrawn; v1.7.5 reverted it. They were never offered as a stable release, so if you are upgrading from v1.6.2 you were never exposed. Everything else from that range is carried forward.

---

Thanks to @dinkalin-ux, @Vict20, @KevlarD-67, @igotyou, @as-wallpen, @jekmanis, @Richardmarkink, @Henxidou001, @dartyukh-afk and @Wojak129 for the reports, scans and hardware confirmations behind this release.

## v1.8.7 (pre-release)

Issues: #393

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **Inverter Clock now shows the time.** It was published as a timestamp sensor, which Home
  Assistant renders as relative time - a counter ticking up every second, indistinguishable
  from a "last updated" field. The state is now the inverter's wall-clock time, e.g.
  `2026-08-26 14:32:05`. The parseable form moves to a `timestamp` attribute alongside
  `drift_seconds` and `drift_minutes`. Affects anyone who enabled the sensor in v1.8.6.

---

## v1.8.6 (pre-release)

Issues: #393

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **New entity: Inverter Clock.** Shows the inverter's own real-time clock as readable
  local time, with `timestamp`, `drift_seconds` and `drift_minutes` attributes so you can
  alert on drift. Time-of-use windows fire against this clock rather than Home Assistant's.
- **New entity: Inverter Clock Sync.** A button that sets the inverter's clock on press -
  the same write as the `sync_inverter_time` action, without the options.
- **Both are disabled by default** and sit together under Diagnostic on the inverter
  device. Enable them in the entity settings. The sensor adds one register read per poll
  and reads nothing at all until enabled; the button writes six holding registers per
  press. Neither is offered on off-grid (SPF/SPE) profiles.
- **Clock sync confirmed working on MIN TL-X.** The action no longer asks for reports or
  logs a notice on every run.
- The clock drift notification now points at the button and the action rather than telling
  you to use the ShinePhone app.

---

## v1.8.5 (pre-release)

Issues: #384

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **SPF: routine battery-direction corrections no longer appear as errors.** In status 12
  (PV Charge + Discharge) the SPF reports an unreliable sign on battery power, so the
  integration resolves the direction from the power balance instead. That is normal
  operation and can fire a dozen times on a sunny day, but it was logged at warning level,
  which put it in Home Assistant's error log under "originated from a custom integration".
  It now logs at debug. The correction itself is unchanged. Reported by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- Corrections that flag a genuine contradiction between the reported sign and the inverter's
  own status (#174) still log at warning, as they should.

---

## v1.8.4 (pre-release)

Issues: #393

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **Clock sync now writes the year the way the inverter expects it.** Register 45 takes a
  **two-digit** year and reports back four — write `26`, read `2026`. That asymmetry appears
  in neither protocol document, and it is why every earlier build was rejected: they all sent
  the full year. Established from a published ESP32 implementation for an SPH5000 and an
  ESPHome forum finding, after both a MIN TL-X and an SPH refused everything else.
  Investigated and sourced by @Vict20. (#393)
- **Each field is now written on its own rather than as a block**, matching that reference —
  both models refused a multi-register write across this range, while the RTC registers
  accept single writes even on hardware that generally does not.
- **The year is still written first**, so a refusal leaves the clock untouched rather than
  half-set, and the clock is read back afterwards with a warning if it does not match.

---

## v1.8.3 (pre-release)

Issues: #393

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.
>
> **Replaces v1.8.0-v1.8.2, which were withdrawn.** Those could leave a MIN TL-X holding the
> wrong year.

- **New action: Sync Inverter Clock — experimental.** The inverter keeps its own real-time
  clock and it drifts, and time period schedules run against that clock rather than Home
  Assistant's, so a window set for 13:00 starts whenever the drifted clock reaches 13:00.
  `growatt_modbus.sync_inverter_time` sets it and reports the drift corrected. (#393)
- **It changes nothing unless the whole clock can be set.** The year is written first and
  read back; if the inverter refuses it, or accepts it and ignores it, nothing else is
  written and your clock is left exactly as it was. This matters — an earlier build wrote the
  year last, five fields landed, and the inverter reset its clock to the year 2000 rather
  than keep a date it considered inconsistent.
- **Known not to work on MIN TL-X.** That model rejects a four-digit year, silently discards
  a two-digit one, and does not support single-register writes at all. Set the time from the
  Growatt app on those.
- **Not attempted on off-grid (SPF/SPE)**, where the year encoding differs and register 51
  means something else entirely.
- **No model has yet been confirmed accepting a full clock write**, so the action says so in
  the UI and in the log every time it runs. If you try it, please report the outcome on
  [#393](https://github.com/0xAHA/Growatt_ModbusTCP/issues/393) either way.
- **Every write failure now reports the device's own reason** instead of "returned error" —
  the Modbus exception code distinguishes a register that does not exist from a value that
  was rejected, and we were discarding it.

---

## v1.8.2 (pre-release, withdrawn)

Issues: #393

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **Clock sync now handles models that store the year as two digits.** A MIN TL-X accepted
  every clock field except the year, refusing `2026` outright. Growatt uses both conventions
  for that register — the off-grid protocol documents an offset from 2000 — so a refused
  four-digit year is now retried as two. Reading handles both as well, otherwise a stored
  `26` decoded as the year 26 AD and the reported drift was two millennia. (#393)
- **A partial clock write now says so**, naming both the registers that were refused and the
  ones that were updated. The single-register fallback cannot be atomic, so knowing the clock
  is part-set rather than untouched matters.

---

## v1.8.1 (pre-release, withdrawn)

Issues: #393

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **Sync Inverter Clock now works on models that refuse a block write.** Some firmware
  rejects writing registers 45-51 as one transaction even though the registers themselves
  are writable, and the action failed outright with "Unknown error". It now retries one
  register at a time, and a refused day-of-week field no longer costs you the clock —
  schedules do not use it. (#393)
- **Clock errors now explain themselves** instead of surfacing as "Unknown error", and the
  log names the specific register a model refuses.

---

## v1.8.0 (pre-release, withdrawn)

Issues: #393

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **New action: Sync Inverter Clock.** The inverter keeps its own real-time clock, and it
  drifts — one SPH was two minutes out, which made a 13:00 export window start at 13:02.
  Time period schedules run against the inverter's clock, not Home Assistant's, so that
  drift moves your schedules. `growatt_modbus.sync_inverter_time` sets it from Home
  Assistant's local time and reports the drift it corrected. Requested by @Vict20. (#393)
- **`min_drift_seconds` skips the write when the clock is already close enough**, so a
  scheduled automation costs nothing on the runs that find nothing to fix. Leave it at 0 for
  a manual one-off.
- **Not available on SPF/SPE.** The off-grid protocol stores the year as an offset from 2000
  and uses register 51 for something other than the weekday, so the standard layout would
  set the year wrongly and overwrite an unrelated register. The action refuses rather than
  guessing; a register scan covering 45-51 from an off-grid model is what is needed to add
  it.

---

## v1.7.7 (pre-release)

Issues: #381, #384, #392

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **SPF: a PV reading of zero that the inverter's own registers contradict is now reported as
  unknown instead of 0.** Some SPF units intermittently report 0 in their PV registers while
  still producing — the Modbus read succeeds, the registers are simply wrong. One reporter's
  poll showed 1,907 W of AC output with only 329 W from the battery, no grid and no
  generator, and PV reading zero. The real figure cannot be recovered, but a gap in the graph
  is honest where a zero is a fabricated measurement that stays in your statistics forever.
  Only applies when every other supply reads zero and the shortfall exceeds 200 W, so genuine
  night-time and battery-only readings are untouched. Reported by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **Battery direction is no longer thrown off by those false zeros.** The SPF sign correction
  compares PV against load; a PV reading of 0 against a real load made it conclude the
  battery must be discharging when it was not.
- **Time period controls no longer write when the value has not changed.** A scheduler that
  recomputes time slots on a timer was writing every slot on every run, including the ones
  that were already correct. These registers are believed to be held in non-volatile memory
  with a finite write budget. Raised by @KevlarD-67. (#392)
- **Documentation: PV Energy Total vs Energy Total on hybrids.** The two sensor descriptions
  contradicted each other — one said Energy Total would be higher, the other said lower. On a
  hybrid, Energy Total counts battery discharge including energy the battery took from the
  grid, so it is normally the larger of the two. Raised by @Vict20. (#381)
- **Documentation: the EEPROM guidance is now labelled as inference.** Growatt marks a few
  VPP registers "Not storage" and says nothing about the rest; treating the rest as
  non-volatile is our caution, not a documented limit. Raised by @KevlarD-67. (#392)
- **Internal: stopped using a device registry attribute Home Assistant deprecated in 2026.8**,
  which would otherwise start writing warnings naming this integration into your log.

## v1.7.6 (pre-release)

Issues: #390

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **SPH: AC Charge Energy Total now reports grid-to-battery energy, not total battery
  charge.** It was showing the battery charge counter, which includes energy from your
  panels — one reporter saw 13,820.7 kWh where the true grid figure was 7,099.8 kWh.
  **Expect this sensor to step down on upgrade**; the new value is the correct one, and it
  matches the "EAC Total" field on the Growatt app's raw device page. Confirmed on hardware
  by @Vict20. (#390)
- **SPH gains AC Charge Energy Today**, from the same corrected register block.
- **SPH loses its Warning Code sensor.** On these models that register holds an energy value,
  not a fault code, so the sensor has only ever reported 0. It is removed automatically.
- **AC Discharge Energy Total is removed from grid-tied models.** No such register exists in
  the protocol for them — the sensor had nothing behind it and could latch a stray reading
  permanently, in one case showing 21,069,824 kWh on a 12 kWh battery. Off-grid models
  (SPF, SPE) genuinely have this register and keep the sensor. Use **Battery Discharge
  Total** instead. (#390)

## v1.7.5 (pre-release)

Issues: #384

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.
>
> **If you use a USB-RS485 adapter and installed any of v1.7.0-v1.7.4, update.** Those
> versions could not read from a serial inverter at all. They have been withdrawn.

- **Serial connections work again.** v1.7.0 introduced a shared connection for serial
  entries. It opened the port, while the polling client — which was never given the shared
  connection — opened the same port a second time. A serial port can only be held once, so
  every read failed with `Could not exclusively lock port` and the inverter went offline.
  This affected **every** serial user, not only those with two inverters. The serial shared
  connection has been removed and behaviour is back to v1.6.6. Reported by @dinkalin-ux with
  the logs that identified it. (#384)
- **A serial port that cannot be opened now explains itself**, instead of appearing as a bare
  `Failed to connect` with the real reason buried in a line above it.

Everything else from v1.7.0-v1.7.4 is unaffected and carried forward: the register scanner's
single-register fallback, `/dev/serial/by-path/` paths in the port list, and the sensor
changes from v1.6.6-v1.6.9.

---

## v1.7.4 (pre-release, withdrawn)

Issues: #384

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **The serial port list now offers `/dev/serial/by-path/` paths as well as `/dev/serial/by-id/`.**
  by-id needs the adapter to have a serial number, and CH340 chips — most cheap USB-RS485
  adapters — do not have one, so two identical adapters produce by-id names that cannot tell
  them apart. by-path names the USB socket instead and is unambiguous. Both are listed and
  labelled by what they follow, so you can pick the one that suits your hardware instead of
  typing it by hand. Raised by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)

---

## v1.7.3 (pre-release, withdrawn)

Issues: #384

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.
>
> **Fixes a serial regression introduced in v1.7.0.** If you are on v1.7.0-v1.7.2 with a
> USB-RS485 adapter, update.

- **Serial ports are released between polls again.** v1.7.0 held the port open for the
  lifetime of the entry. A serial port is exclusive, so on some setups the second config
  entry could never open it and reported `Could not exclusively lock port` on every poll,
  taking that inverter permanently offline. Reopening costs about 2 ms. Reported by
  @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **A serial port that cannot be opened now says why.** Previously this surfaced only as
  `Failed to connect`, with the real reason buried in a pymodbus line above it. The warning
  now names the likely cause and the command that confirms it.
- **Documentation: choosing a stable serial path.** CH340 adapters — the most common cheap
  USB-RS485 type — have no serial number, so `/dev/serial/by-id/` cannot tell two of them
  apart and `/dev/ttyUSBn` numbering swaps between reboots. `by-path` is the right choice
  for those. This makes it easy to configure two entries that unknowingly point at the same
  adapter.

---

## v1.7.2 (pre-release, withdrawn)

Issues: #384

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **Serial connection sharing now recognises the same adapter under different path names.**
  One USB adapter answers to `/dev/ttyUSB2`, `/dev/serial/by-id/...` and
  `/dev/serial/by-path/...` at once, and the setup wizard recommends the by-id form — so two
  entries can name one physical port differently. v1.7.0 keyed on the configured path, gave
  them separate connections and let them collide on the same bus, which is the exact problem
  it was meant to prevent. Paths are now resolved before matching. **Only affects setups with
  two or more entries on one adapter.** (#384)

---

## v1.7.1 (pre-release, withdrawn)

Issues: #389

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **The register scanner now falls back to single-register reads when a gateway refuses
  blocks.** It read 125 registers per request and never tried anything smaller, so a
  bandwidth-limited bridge — LoRa gateways especially — returned an error for every register
  and produced a scan that looked like a dead device. It now detects this on the first failed
  block, drops to one register per request for the rest of the scan and says so in the log.
  Slower, but it returns data instead of nothing. Reported by @Henxidou001. (#389)

---

## v1.7.0 (pre-release, withdrawn)

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **Multiple inverters on one USB-RS485 adapter now share a single connection.** Until now
  each entry opened its own serial client on the same adapter and paced only itself, so two
  pollers interleaved their frames on one bus with nothing coordinating them — which shows up
  as random, unexplained read failures on both inverters. Serial entries on the same device
  path are now serialised behind one lock, the same way TCP entries on the same host:port
  already were. **Only affects setups with two or more entries on one adapter**; single-entry
  setups are unchanged, and TCP is untouched.

---

## v1.6.9 (pre-release)

Issues: #384

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **No sensor publishes a zero for a reading it could not take.** v1.6.6 fixed this for the
  twelve PV sensors; the same defect remained in 57 others, including AC power, AC voltage,
  grid voltage, load power, temperatures and every energy counter. All of them now go
  *unknown* for that poll, leaving a gap in history rather than a zero that cannot afterwards
  be told apart from a real measurement. Genuine zeros are still recorded. Applies to every
  profile. Reported by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **Battery charge and discharge power no longer both read 0 W on a failed read**, which was
  indistinguishable from an idle battery. Derived values — total solar power, per-phase power
  calculated from voltage and current — now inherit the read state of their inputs.
- **Changing connection settings no longer logs a blocking-call warning.** Opening the
  options page on a serial setup enumerated serial ports on the event loop, which Home
  Assistant reports with a traceback asking you to file a bug. Cosmetic, but noisy. Reported
  by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)

---

## v1.6.8 (pre-release)

Issues: #384

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **Total Solar Power now goes unknown on a failed read, instead of zero.** v1.6.6 stopped
  the per-string PV sensors publishing a zero when their block could not be read, but the
  total is calculated from those strings and was still publishing 0 W - so the headline solar
  sensor, and the energy-flow cards that read it, kept showing the drop the earlier fix was
  meant to remove. Applies to every profile. Per-string power on models that report only
  voltage and current (MIN TL-XH2) is corrected the same way. (#384)

---

## v1.6.7 (pre-release)

Issues: #386

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **SPH time-slot entities are now named after the slot the inverter actually uses.** The
  three Grid First slots displayed as "Grid First Period 7/8/9" but are slots **1, 2 and 3**
  in the Growatt app and in the protocol, and the Battery First slots displayed as "AC Charge
  Time Period" with no indication of which app group they belonged to. Entity IDs are
  unchanged, so automations keep working - only the displayed names are corrected. Reported
  by @Vict20. (#386)

---

## v1.6.6 (pre-release)

Issues: #361, #384, #385

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **A failed read no longer publishes a solar reading of zero.** When a Modbus block read
  failed, the registers behind it were reported as 0 rather than as missing - so a single
  dropped frame put a vertical drop to 0 W in the solar graph, recovering on the next poll,
  with no error anywhere. PV voltage, current and power now go *unknown* for that poll
  instead, leaving a gap in history rather than a zero that cannot afterwards be told apart
  from a real measurement. A genuine zero is still recorded. Reported by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **MIN TL-XH2 now reports inverter temperature.** That model answers Illegal Function
  across the base register range, which is where every other profile reads this from, so it
  had no temperature source at all. It now uses VPP register 31114. Reported by
  @Richardmarkink. (#361)
- **Setting a control to the value it already has no longer writes to the inverter.** These
  registers are held in EEPROM, which has a finite number of write cycles. Nothing polls or
  writes on its own, but an automation re-applying the same value on a schedule used to burn
  a cycle every run for no effect. Raised by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)
- **A wrong protocol variant can now be corrected without deleting the integration.** Ten
  inverter families exist as two register maps, chosen by auto-detection at setup. When that
  choice was wrong there was no way back - the profile list shows one name for both, and
  re-selecting it resolved through the same setting that was already wrong. The Configure
  page now has a **Protocol variant** field (Auto / Legacy V1.39 / VPP V2.01), and names the
  register map currently loaded. Leaving it on Auto changes nothing. (#385)

---

## v1.6.5 (pre-release)

Issues: #353

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **WIT grid charging now works on models that reject Write Single Register.** Register
  30410 (VPP AC charge enable) accepts only FC 0x10 on some WIT hardware. The write was
  attempted with FC 0x06, and a refusal was logged as a warning and stepped over - so every
  other register in the mode sequence succeeded and grid charging silently never engaged.
  It now falls back to FC 0x10 when FC 0x06 is refused, and reports a real failure when
  neither works. Reported by @jekmanis. (#353)
- Documentation: register 30476 (WIT priority mode) is no longer described as read-only. It
  is writable on some models - the integration's TOU Default Mode control writes it - and
  the guide now says so rather than telling people not to try. (#353)

---

## v1.6.4 (pre-release)

Issues: #377, #383, #384

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release.

- **SPH V2.01 profiles now read battery energy on hardware without VPP support.** "SPH
  (3-6kW)" resolves to the V2.01 variant on many entries, and a V1.39 inverter on that
  profile never reads the 31000 range - so Battery Charge/Discharge Today and Total showed a
  permanent 0.0 while voltage and SOC worked. Reported by @igotyou. (#377)
- **Two new SPF controls, disabled by default: Bulk and Float Charge Voltage.** 48.0-58.4 V,
  available only on a self-defined battery type. Created disabled because an in-range but
  wrong value affects your battery rather than a reading - enable them under the
  integration's entities list if you want them. Requested by @dinkalin-ux. (#384)

- **SPH V2.01 profiles now read battery energy on hardware without VPP support.** "SPH
  (3-6kW)" resolves to the V2.01 variant on many entries, and a V1.39 inverter on that
  profile never reads the 31000 range - so Battery Charge/Discharge Today and Total showed a
  permanent 0.0 while voltage and SOC worked. The 1000-range registers now carry the name
  the integration looks for, with the VPP block as the fallback. Reported by @igotyou. (#377)
- **Connection settings can be changed after setup.** The USB/serial port, baud rate, host
  and TCP port are now editable from the integration's Configure page. Previously the only
  way to change them was to delete the entry and add it again, which loses entity IDs and
  with them automations, dashboards and statistics history. Requested by @dartyukh-afk. (#383)
- **The serial port picker now offers `/dev/serial/by-id/` paths and marks them as stable.**
  These are tied to the adapter's own serial number, so they survive a reboot; `/dev/ttyUSB0`
  is assigned in plug order and can move to a different device when more than one USB serial
  adapter is attached. (#383)

---

## v1.6.3 (pre-release)

Issues: #376, #377, #378, #379, #381

> **Pre-release for testing.** v1.6.2 remains the stable release and is unaffected by
> everything below. Most of this is SPH and SPF work that does not touch the write-path
> changes in v1.6.2.

- **SPH 3-6kW and 7-10kW now report battery charge and discharge energy.** Charge/Discharge
  Today and Total published a constant 0 on these profiles because the registers were never
  mapped. Load consumption energy arrives at the same time. Reported by @igotyou, confirmed
  against ShinePhone. (#377)
- **New control on SPF 3000-6000 ES Plus: Max Charge Current.** The total charging current
  across solar and utility, 10-100 A. It is unavailable when Battery Type is Lithium, which
  is a state the inverter does not allow it to be set in. Reported by @dinkalin-ux, range
  taken from the SPF 6000ES Plus manual. (#376)
- **Three-string MOD, MID and SPH 7-10kW systems no longer under-report daily solar.** PV3
  had no energy counter in the register map, and the daily solar figure is the sum of the
  per-string counters — so a whole string was missing from it. On a MID 25KTL3-XH that was
  17.6 kWh against the portal's 29.5. PV3 Energy Today and Total also start reporting.
  Reported by @as-wallpen, register addresses derived and confirmed with @KevlarD-67. (#381)
- **Register scans now name the register map instead of reporting UNKNOWN.** Affected any
  device identified by DTC, which is most of them. Diagnostic output only — no change to how
  the integration runs. (#379)
- SPH V2.01 profiles had registers 1052-1055 labelled as grid import, which is battery
  discharge energy; grid import was already mapped correctly elsewhere in the same profiles.
  No entity changes. (#378)

---

## v1.6.2

Issues: #331, #375, #380

> **First stable release of the 1.6 line.** v1.6.0 and v1.6.1 were pre-releases, so if you
> are coming from v1.5.5 you are getting all three at once — their notes are below and
> worth reading, particularly if you have a MOD or MID TL3-XH.

- **Writes now recover from a dropped socket, as reads already did.** On a gateway or
  datalogger that closes idle connections, the first write after a drop failed and the
  control silently did not take effect, while the first read after a drop retried and
  succeeded. Reported by @alanmk. (#375)
- **WIT Mode (VPP) now applies as one operation.** Setting Hold, Charge or Discharge writes
  six to eight registers, and a poll could previously land between them — leaving the
  inverter with control authority granted but no power setpoint, or a schedule with no
  period count. The sequence now holds the connection from first write to last, so it
  either applies completely or fails without starting. Reported by @Wojak129, and
  diagnosed from @rine77's description of the symptom. (#331)
- **Peak-shaving limits stay unavailable until they are configured.** On MOD and MID
  TL3-XH, Import Limit, Export Limit and AC Charge Max Power previously showed 3000 kW or
  6553.5 kW on systems where peak shaving had never been set up in the portal. An
  unavailable entity here now means "not configured", not a connection problem. Reserve SOC
  is unaffected and still always shown. Reported by @as-wallpen. (#380)

Two limits are unchanged and now documented in the [WIT guide](https://0xaha.github.io/Growatt_ModbusTCP/controls/wit-guide/):
a write can still wait behind a running poll, and Mode (VPP) reports the last command sent
rather than reading the inverter back.

Also in this release: the MOD TL3-XH profile note on grid import now records that
`power_to_user` (3041/3042) does track sustained grid import on that model, corrected
against 637 logged samples from @KevlarD-67. Documentation only — no entity changes. (#373)

---

## v1.6.1 (pre-release)

Issues: #374

> **Fixes a defect in the v1.6.0 pre-release.** If you installed v1.6.0 on a MOD or MID
> TL3-XH, please take this one — v1.5.5 remains the stable release and was never affected.

- **Five writable VPP controls appeared on MOD TL3-XH in v1.6.0 and should not have.**
  Control Authority, Remote Power Control, Remote Duration, Remote Charge/Discharge Power
  and VPP AC Charge Enable were created as operable entities, including a −100…+100 %
  power slider. v1.6.0 marked those registers read-only in the profile, but nothing read
  that flag.

  They are removed on upgrade. Nothing was written to them and they were all at their safe
  values; the exposure is what is being fixed.

- **A profile marking a register read-only now withholds the control.** Previously `access`
  was documentation only. This also removes one pre-existing control — SPE Grid Compliance
  Region (register 117), which the profile already described as firmware-determined with
  writes rejected.

- The four VPP diagnostic sensors, the peak-shaving sensors and the Grid Charge Stopped SOC
  control from v1.6.0 are unaffected and stay.

Reported by @KevlarD-67, with the mechanism traced to the exact line.

---

## v1.6.0 (pre-release)

Issues: #371, #372, #373 — all on MOD/MID TL3-XH

> **This is a pre-release, for testing.** Everything below was measured on a single
> MOD 10KTL3-XH running DN1.0 firmware. The peak-shaving registers appear in no public
> Growatt protocol document, so they rest on that one machine alone. If you run a MOD or
> MID TL3-XH, confirming these values match your Growatt portal would be genuinely useful —
> please comment on [#372](https://github.com/0xAHA/Growatt_ModbusTCP/issues/372).
>
> HACS will not offer this unless you enable beta versions on the integration.

- **Two MOD controls that never worked have been removed.** Charge Power Rate (1090) and
  AC Charge Enable (1092) reject writes outright on this hardware — the whole holding block
  1000-1124 is unimplemented. Use **Charge Power Rate (3047)** and **Allow Grid Charge
  (3049)** instead, both confirmed working. The old entities are removed on upgrade rather
  than left behind as unavailable; **check any automations that referenced them.**
- **New control: Grid Charge Stopped SOC.** Caps charging from the grid specifically,
  separate from Charge Stopped SOC which applies to any source — the lower of the two wins.
  Growatt exposes it in neither the app nor the portal, and on the reporting system it
  silently held grid charging at 55% for two days while the general limit read 100%.
- **New diagnostic sensors: Import Limit, Export Limit, Peak Shaving Reserve SOC, AC Charge
  Max Power.** Peak-shaving settings configured in the Growatt portal, previously invisible.
- **VPP remote power control state is now visible on MOD** (disabled by default): Control
  Authority, Remote Power Control, Commanded Power and Last Setpoint. Read-only for now —
  the commanded power is a target rather than a cap and will import from the grid to reach
  it even with grid charging disabled, so writable controls need a guard first.
- Controls dropped from a profile are now removed from Home Assistant rather than lingering
  as unavailable, matching the behaviour sensors have had since v1.5.4.

All three issues were reported by @KevlarD-67 with hardware measurements — A/B writes on one
connection, portal round-trips, and full before/after register snapshots.

---

## v1.5.5

Issues: #360, #370

- **VPP control entities no longer freeze after a single failed read.** Control Authority,
  VPP Export Limit and Remote Power Control (registers 30100, 30200-30201, 30407-30410)
  were skipped for the rest of the session after one unanswered read, so the entity kept
  reporting its last value indefinitely. They now retry every 5 minutes, matching the
  behaviour already used for the VPP input ranges. Affects WIT and other VPP-capable
  models. Diagnosed by @Svetlonos76.
- **New block size option: 5 registers.** For gateways that reject 10-register reads but
  manage smaller ones — previously the only working choice was 1 register, which on a
  large profile means ~216 reads per poll. Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus
  → Configure → Max Register Block Size. Found by @Xybertecnic.
- **A repair notice now appears if your configured inverter model no longer exists.**
  Previously it fell back to a MIN 7-10kW profile silently, and most sensors would be
  missing or stuck at zero with nothing to explain why. Mainly affects anyone who has
  hand-edited a profile file, which an update then replaces.
- The register scanner now offers the same block sizes as the integration (125, 50, 25,
  10, 5, 1), so a scan can reproduce what the poller is doing.
- Diagnostics now report suppressed VPP holding blocks alongside suppressed input ranges.

---

## v1.5.4

Issues: #360, #362

- **Removed sensors now disappear instead of showing `unavailable`.** If v1.5.3 left you
  with a DC-DC Temperature entity stuck as unavailable, upgrading clears it.
- Stale entities are now cleared based on the active profile, so sensors dropped in future
  releases tidy up after themselves.

---

## v1.5.3

Issues: #360, #362

**Coming from v1.5.1?** v1.5.2 was a pre-release, so you get its changes too — see below.

- **DC-DC Temperature no longer appears on models that don't have the sensor.** It was
  reporting 0.0 °C on MIN, SPH, SPH-TL3, WIT and TL-XH. MOD, MID, SPF and SPE keep theirs —
  those are real readings.
- **SPH-TL3 and SPA-TL3 gain IPM and Boost temperature** (registers 94/95). Both were
  present but unmapped, so both read 0.0 °C.
- **SPA-TL3 regains Energy Today and Energy Total** — confirmed on hardware, not the solar
  generation figures they were mistaken for.

---

## v1.5.2

Issues: #360, #362

- **Scanning a disabled integration now keeps your tuned settings.** Select your inverter
  under **Config entry** rather than typing the host and port, and the scan inherits your
  slave ID, Modbus delay and block size. Typing the connection by hand still starts from
  defaults, which a sensitive gateway may not tolerate. Reported by @Xybertecnic.
- **New profile: SPA-TL3 (AC Storage, 3-Phase) 4-10kW**, selected automatically by
  DTC 3725. Both SPA options now state their phase count, so the choice no longer depends
  on knowing which register range your model serves.
  - If your SPA-TL3 was auto-detected onto SPH-TL3, its PV entities disappear on
    upgrade. They only ever reported zero.
- **`Charge Stopped SOC (Battery First)` renamed to `Charge Stopped SOC`.** Register 3048
  also governs charging under Load Priority, so the old name suggested it could be ignored
  outside Battery First. Entity IDs are unchanged. Measured and reported by @as-wallpen.
- **SPA gains AC current, output power, inverter status, AC energy and temperatures** from
  the 2000-2124 range. These come from the protocol and have not yet been read on a device —
  a scan from a single-phase SPA would confirm them. AC voltage and frequency keep their
  existing measured registers. Three-phase SPA-TL3 is unaffected.
- **The "settings are being reverted" notice** now points at Growatt's cloud pushing
  settings down — remote control or a schedule set in the ShinePhone app — rather than a
  connected dongle on its own.
- **New: `tools/protocol_coverage.py`**, which reports registers the protocol documents
  that no profile maps. Also corrects the range summary, which listed 2000-2124 as SPH
  rather than SPA.

---

## v1.5.1

Issues: #360

- **Fix: the register scanner returned almost nothing on slower gateways.**
  The scanner uses its own Modbus client, separate from the one that does the polling —
  and unlike the poller it never paused between reads. It sent requests as fast as the
  socket accepted them.

  On an adapter that needs settling time between requests, that meant nearly every read in
  the scan failed. The resulting CSV looked like a dead inverter, on a system whose sensors
  were updating perfectly well a moment earlier. One user got two consecutive scans back
  with a handful of usable rows out of more than a thousand.

  The scan now paces itself using the same **Modbus delay** already configured for your
  inverter, since that value is tuned to what your gateway tolerates. The pacing used is
  recorded in the scan file so it is visible in any report.

  Scans on slow links will take noticeably longer than before. That is the fix working —
  the previous speed was the cause of the empty results.

  Reported by @Xybertecnic, whose scans kept coming back empty while the integration itself
  ran fine — a contradiction that turned out to be entirely our doing.

---

## v1.5.0

Issues: #360, #362, #367

> ### Some control entities are renamed
>
> Twelve number, select and time entities gain the sub-device they belong to in their
> displayed name — **"Growatt Battery Work Mode"** rather than "Growatt Work Mode".
>
> **Nothing breaks.** Entity IDs live in Home Assistant's registry and do not change, so
> automations, scripts, template sensors and dashboard cards keep working exactly as they
> are. Only the label shown in the UI moves. If you search for a control by name and don't
> recognise it, look for the sub-device word.
>
> This also fixes WIT inverters showing **"Growatt Growatt TOU Period 1 Start"** — the
> device name was being applied twice.

### Problems now surfaced in the UI instead of the log

Two conditions used to leave users running a degraded setup with no way to know. Both now
appear under **Settings → Repairs**.

- **Settings being reverted.** Local changes that the inverter silently discards — usually
  a ShineWiFi dongle restoring cloud settings, sometimes a prerequisite that isn't enabled.
  Previously a notification that scrolled away; a repair persists until the cause is fixed.

- **An RS485 gateway returning mismatched responses.** Some adapters answer a request with
  a complete, valid response to an *earlier* one. Since v1.3.7 these are discarded, so your
  data stays correct — but the reads are lost and the only evidence was a log line. One
  reporter's gateway was doing this on roughly one poll in three and only found out by
  reading logs. Raised once per session at 5% or more across at least 200 reads, with the
  gateway address and rate, linking [the gateway guide](docs/troubleshooting/rs485-gateways.md).

### Sensor names can now be translated

All 169 sensor names moved out of Python and into the translation files. The integration
already shipped 22 languages, but they only covered the setup and options screens — sensor
names were hardcoded English regardless of your Home Assistant language. Other languages
can now be contributed without touching code.

English text is unchanged, and a test asserts that by comparing every string against the
original definitions.

### Model identification

- **DTC 5001 and 5002 corrected.** `MID 33-36KTL3-X(Pro.E)` and `MID 3-33KTL3-X3` were
  documented under 5002; they belong to 5001. In Growatt's table those two rows fall at the
  top of the next page under a merged cell, so they read as 5002 unless you check where the
  merge begins. The corrected split is also the sensible one — 5001 is every MID model,
  5002 every MOD.

- **The MAX / MAX-X family was missing** from the published protocol page along with DTC
  3501 and 5401, and `3735` was named "SPA 3000-6000TL BL" where the specification says
  "SPA 3000TL BL-UP". That page held its own copy of the table, a fourth alongside two code
  modules and the troubleshooting page. All four now derive from one registry, three of them
  enforced by tests.

### Internal

- **Every entity now shares one base class.** Twenty classes each carried their own unique
  ID, device assignment and naming flag, and the copies had drifted into two conventions at
  once. Consolidating them is what exposed the naming inconsistency above.

- **Contributor documentation** gained twelve verification rules drawn from real defects —
  check the protocol documents before inferring a register, state which register space you
  mean, and treat "Read OK" as evidence the address responded rather than that the value
  means anything.

## v1.4.1

Issues: #362

Fixes a v1.4.0 regression and two older bugs it exposed. Reported by @as-wallpen, who
noticed the symptom rather than the absence.

- **Fix: MOD / MID Battery Temperature reported 0.0 °C instead of disappearing.**
  v1.4.0 identified register 3176 as the DC-DC converter stage and removed it as a
  battery reading, but the sensor kept being created and fell back to its default. The
  result was worse than the bug being fixed: a dashboard showed a battery sitting at
  freezing rather than a sensor that no longer existed.

  The sensor's condition is `hasattr(data, 'battery_temp')`, which reads like "only if
  the profile provides it" — but `battery_temp` is a dataclass field with a `0.0`
  default, so the attribute always exists and the gate can never fail. It is now excluded
  from the MOD/MID sensor sets, which is the only filter that actually applies.

- **Fix: entity cleanup never ran, at all.** Three cleanup blocks were gated on
  `coordinator.data.serial_number` being populated during setup. That check can never
  pass: `async_config_entry_first_refresh()` deliberately does not contact the inverter
  (#262) — it seeds an empty placeholder and defers the real poll to a background task
  that runs after setup returns. So every removal was dead code, and had been since that
  change. Two of the three predate v1.4.0.

  The profile-based cleanups need no live data — whether a register is in the profile is
  a static fact — so they now run unconditionally. The two VPP cleanups genuinely do need
  a live read, and now run once on the first poll that reaches the inverter.

  If you are on MOD/MID, the stale **Battery Temperature**, **Charge Stopped SOC** and
  **Discharge Stopped SOC** entities will be removed on next startup.

- **Fix: the profile-based cleanup read the wrong dictionary.** It looked for
  `holding_registers` on the profile metadata, where the register map is only a name.
  Resolved through `REGISTER_MAPS` now.

- **Testing: 31 sensor conditions were found to be decorative.** A `hasattr()` gate is
  only meaningful for attributes set dynamically; against a dataclass field it always
  passes. Most are harmless, because the profiles listing them also define the register —
  but they are now enumerated, and a test fails if a new one appears or an existing one
  silently stops being one. Adding a gate that cannot fail is now a deliberate act.

---

## v1.4.0

Issues: #360, #362, #367

Includes everything from the v1.3.7 pre-release.

> ### ⚠️ MOD / MID owners: three entity changes
>
> - **Battery Temperature is removed.** Register 3176 turned out to be `Bdc1Temp1` — the
>   DC-DC converter stage inside the inverter, not the battery. It now appears as
>   **DC-DC Temperature**. There is no replacement: on these systems the BMS does not
>   publish a cell temperature over Modbus.
> - **Charge Stopped SOC / Discharge Stopped SOC are removed.** Registers 1071 and 1091
>   accept writes and silently ignore them on this hardware. Use **Charge Stopped SOC
>   (Battery First)** and **Discharge Stopped SOC**, which are confirmed working.
> - **"Grid First Discharge Stopped SOC" is now "Discharge Stopped SOC"** — the entity ID
>   is unchanged, so automations keep working.
>
> The old entities are removed from the registry automatically on startup.

### Data integrity

- **Malformed Modbus responses are no longer written to the register cache** *(from
  v1.3.7)*. Register blocks are stored positionally, so a short response — or a stale
  frame belonging to a different request — had its words written onto registers they
  never belonged to. The result was a plausible-looking wrong number: @tdalejandro
  decoded their own corrupt readings and found the ASCII `"32ST"`, four characters of the
  inverter's serial number, published as **85,893,614.8 W** of AC power. The non-shared
  read path had checked response length since v1.3.5, but a hub is created for *every*
  TCP entry, so that guard only ever covered serial/RTU users.

  On a marginal gateway this converts polls that were silently producing wrong values
  into polls that visibly fail, so your failure count may go **up**. That is the fix
  working.

  **The guard checks `!= count`, not `< count`, and that turns out to be the whole
  fix.** Every mismatch measured in the field came back **longer** than requested —
  31 of them, 30 returning exactly 125 registers whatever was asked for. A length check
  for *short* responses would have caught **none of them**. The failure is not a
  truncated frame: it is a complete, valid response to an *earlier* request being
  replayed to the current one. @tdalejandro proposed the `!=` and then measured the data
  that showed it was doing all the work.

- **Which gateways are affected.** Two independent setups now bracket this. A Waveshare
  RS485 TO POE ETH (B) doing genuine Modbus-TCP-to-RTU translation showed **zero**
  mismatches and 26 days of clean statistics from *before* the guard existed — so on good
  hardware there was never anything to catch. A ShineWiFi-class serial bridge mismatches
  roughly one poll in three. A persistent socket is not the cause: the clean setup uses
  the same shared connection and the same 60 s interval. See
  [RS485 gateways](docs/troubleshooting/rs485-gateways.md).

- **The adaptive backoff never engaged on TCP connections** *(from v1.3.7)*. The shared
  path returned before reaching the failure counters.

### Detection

- **MIN inverters were being detected as MIC.** DTC 5200 covers both families in
  Growatt's own table, so a probe of registers 59-62 decides between them — and it
  accepted any non-zero value as plausible daily energy. A MIN 5000TL-X2 matched on the
  first test and ran on the MIC profile with 23 entities instead of 41, while a valid
  register was rejected every poll for looking implausible as a daily total. Reported and
  diagnosed by @tdalejandro.

- **Unconfirmed profile mappings now say so.** Every DTC entry records whether its
  mapping has been verified against real hardware. Previously any known DTC reported
  "Very High" confidence, which conflated two different things: the DTC identifies the
  *model* reliably, but the *profile* behind it may never have been tested. An SPA owner
  was told Very High while running an SPH profile that gave PV entities to a device with
  no solar inputs. Unconfirmed mappings now warn in the log and are marked in the
  register scanner and the [DTC documentation](docs/troubleshooting/dtc-debugging.md).

- **Added the MAX / MAX-X family** (DTC 5000, 5500, 5501, 5502), which was missing
  entirely. Checked against Growatt VPP 2.03 Table 3-1.

### New data

- **SPA and SPH-TL3 gain BMS sensors**: State of Health, cycle count, BMS status and BMS
  error (registers 1083/1085/1095/1096). These are documented V1.39 registers that were
  simply never implemented for these profiles. **SOH is register 1096** — not 31218, as
  previously stated on #360.

- **The register scanner now covers 2000-2124.** The storage protocol gives SPA a second
  input block there that SPH does not have, and no scan had ever included it.

### Fixes

- **Options no longer lost when saving.** The options flow replaced the stored dict with
  whatever the form submitted, so any setting without a UI field — `inter_slave_delay` —
  reverted to its default whenever any other option was changed.

- **Register 3136 was defined twice in the MIN TL-XH profile.** Python keeps the last
  value silently, so a temperature mapping had never existed at runtime. A test now
  parses the profile sources to catch duplicate register addresses, which cannot be seen
  after import.

### Confirmed on hardware

The integration-quality work from v1.3.0-v1.3.2 — the `runtime_data` migration, the
shared entity base class, the diagnostics platform and `PARALLEL_UPDATES` — shipped as
pre-releases because there was no way to verify it locally. A MID 25KTL3-XH owner ran the
full checklist on a direct v1.3.0 → v1.3.7 upgrade ([#367](https://github.com/0xAHA/Growatt_ModbusTCP/issues/367)):

- **89 of 89 sensors populated**, none unavailable, plus 9 number and 21 select entities
- **Writes verified** — discharge rate 100 → 99 → 100, `verified_state` on both, value read
  back in the same poll cycle, no reversion under `PARALLEL_UPDATES = 1`
- **Register scanner** — 2300 registers across 17 ranges, 523 non-zero, zero read errors
- **Diagnostics download** — 7235 bytes across client / coordinator / data / entry /
  shared_connection
- **Entity history intact**, which was the real risk in the entity refactor: `energy_total`
  runs unbroken from 139.3 kWh on 9 July to 2512.7 kWh, monotonic, with no reset at the
  upgrade point. The `unique_id`s really are byte-identical.

One upgrade note from that report: Home Assistant returned 502 for roughly two minutes
after restart on a large instance (~1100 entities) before coming back cleanly. Probably
unrelated to this integration, but worth knowing before anyone reaches for a rollback too
early.

### Not changed, deliberately

- **No plausibility bound on decoded values.** It was proposed as a second line of
  defence, but after 48 hours on the response-length guard @tdalejandro measured zero
  impossible values and recommended against the extra complexity. A stale frame that
  happens to match the requested length would still slip through — that residual is now
  accepted knowingly rather than unknowingly.

- **`battery_temp` on MIN TL-XH.** The same register 3176 is very likely the DC-DC stage
  there too, but no TL-XH owner has compared it against their BMS, and changing it on
  another model's evidence is what this release exists to avoid.

## v1.3.7 (pre-release)

Issues: #367

> **Pre-release.** This changes what happens when a Modbus read comes back malformed —
> from "use it anyway" to "discard it". On a marginal RS485 gateway that will convert
> polls that were *silently producing wrong values* into polls that visibly fail. That is
> the correct trade, but the failure count in your log may go **up**. That is the fix
> working, not a new fault.

- **Fix: malformed responses were written into the register cache on all TCP setups.**
  Register blocks are stored positionally — the first returned word is assumed to be the
  block's start address. When a response came back short, or was a stale frame belonging
  to a different request, its words were still written sequentially from the start
  address, landing on registers they never belonged to.

  The result was not a missing sensor but a *plausible-looking wrong number*. @tdalejandro
  decoded their own corrupt readings and found `0x33325354` — the ASCII `"32ST"`, four
  characters of the inverter's serial number — published as **85,893,614.8 W** of AC
  power, and the firmware version string published as PV2 power. Because
  `total_increasing` energy sensors are affected too, those values entered long-term
  statistics.

  The non-shared read path has validated response length since v1.3.5. The shared hub did
  not — and since a hub is created for **every** TCP entry, not only ones genuinely
  sharing a gateway, that guard in practice only ever protected serial/RTU users. The
  exposed group was everyone on TCP.

  Diagnosed by @tdalejandro, including the proposed fix, which is what shipped.

- **A response *longer* than requested is now rejected too.**
  The existing guard tested `< count`. An over-long response is an equally strong sign of
  a misaligned or stale frame and costs nothing to catch, so the check is `!= count`.

- **Fix: the adaptive backoff never engaged on TCP connections.**
  The shared path returned before reaching the read-failure counters, so
  `_consecutive_read_failures` never moved for any TCP entry and the slow-poll backoff
  after repeated failures could not trigger. Found while fixing the above — the same
  guard-on-one-path-only pattern.

- **A detected misalignment now drains the receive buffer.**
  A misaligned stream stays misaligned, which is why the corrupt values repeated
  byte-for-byte instead of varying. Draining on detection gives the next read a clean
  start rather than inheriting the same offset.

- **Testing:** 15 new tests covering the guard, including the reporter's exact
  serial-number frame. Verified by disabling the guard and confirming they fail.

---

## v1.3.6

Issues: #367

**Update promptly if you set the Max Register Block Size option on v1.3.5.**

- **Fix: saving the block-size option took every entity unavailable on some setups.**
  v1.3.5 changed the options flow to store the block size as a label (`"25 registers"`)
  and updated the parsing in the shared-connection path only. The other fetch path still
  called `int()` on it, which raised `ValueError` on every poll. That includes
  **"Auto (recommended)"** — a truthy string, so it never hit the fallback either.

  The error was caught by the retry loop rather than crashing Home Assistant, so the
  visible symptom was every sensor going unavailable with `Error during data fetch` in
  the log. It triggered on *any* options save, because the field is required.

  Affected: entries **not** using a shared connection — serial/RTU, or TCP entries that
  don't share a host:port with another entry. Shared-connection setups were unaffected.

  Reported by @tdalejandro, who diffed the two call sites and identified the exact cause.

- **Internal: the two fetch paths no longer duplicate their option handling.**
  The blocks were byte-identical apart from the two lines above, which is how they drifted
  out of sync in the first place. Both now call one `_apply_client_options()`.

- **Testing: replaced the test that should have caught this.**
  The old one asserted `resolve_block_size(stored_value) == 25` — it called the helper on
  its own output, proving only that the helper worked, and stayed green throughout. It now
  drives the coordinator and checks what actually reaches the client, across every offered
  block-size label.

---

## v1.3.5

Issues: #360, #367

- **Fix: the "Max Register Block Size" option could never be saved.**
  Reported as two different symptoms: @Xybertecnic saw a dropdown with **nothing
  selected** that failed when changed, and @tdalejandro found the option had **zero
  effect** on read behaviour. Same cause.

  The selector shipped in v1.2.0 as `vol.In({0: "Auto", 25: "25 registers", ...})` — a
  dict keyed by integers, with `default=0`. It is now a list of string labels with a
  label default, matching every other selector in the same form.

  **The read path was always wired correctly.** `_block_size_override` reaches the
  decoder exactly as intended; the option simply never got as far as being stored. That
  is why the code inspection I offered on #367 looked right and the behaviour was still
  wrong.

  Existing entries do not need migrating — the resolver accepts both the label form and
  any integer a previous version managed to persist.

  **If you set this option on v1.2.0-v1.3.4, please set it again.** It almost certainly
  did not take effect.

- **On the exact mechanism:** two explanations fit — integer dict keys not round-tripping
  through the frontend, or `default=0` being falsy so the field rendered unselected and a
  Required field with no value refused to submit. I could not distinguish them without a
  running Home Assistant, and the fix addresses both. Worth stating plainly rather than
  asserting a cause I could not verify.

  Notably `config_flow.py` also has an integer-keyed **baudrate** selector that has
  shipped for many releases and appears to work — which is what makes the first
  explanation doubtful. It is deliberately left alone.

- **21 new tests** covering the option resolver and the selector's shape, including
  integers from the broken versions and junk values falling back to Auto rather than
  raising.

---

## v1.3.4

Issues: #367

- **Fix: a truncated read could fabricate physically impossible values and write them into
  long-term statistics.**
  Reported by @tdalejandro with unusually good evidence — `pv1_power` published as
  **65,536,000 W**, `pv2_power` as **109,544,683 W**, and the same values recurring
  byte-for-byte 14 hours apart. That repetition is what identified the cause.

  Decoded as 32-bit pairs, two of the three impossible values had a low word of *exactly
  zero*. The decoder was substituting `0` for a pair register missing from the read cache,
  so a truncated block that captured the high word and not the low word decoded as
  `high << 16` — a high word of 10000 becoming 65,536,000 W.

  The protocol leaves no ambiguity here: `UINT32`/`INT32` are defined as "high word first,
  low word last", and every 32-bit entry in the register table declares a length of 2. A
  32-bit value always occupies both registers, so a missing partner cannot mean zero — it
  means the read did not complete. The decoder now returns no value in that case.

  This is protocol-level rather than profile-specific, so it applies to every 32-bit
  register across every profile.

  **What changes for you:** nothing, unless your gateway is truncating responses. Values
  that previously appeared as millions of watts will now read 0 for that poll instead.
  Still not ideal, but it no longer corrupts Energy Dashboard history — which is
  permanent, and has to be repaired by hand.

- **Note:** if you already have corrupted hourly statistics, Developer Tools → Statistics
  can correct the affected means without touching the database.

- **Known remaining:** five call sites in the WIT battery-power path use the same
  substitution. They are not fixed here because in that code `pair_addr` may legitimately
  be `None` — meaning the profile genuinely has no high word — which is a different case
  from "the register exists but wasn't read". Separating those safely needs a WIT owner to
  verify, given that path's history in #247 and #323.

---

## v1.3.3

Issues: #361

- **Fix: four wrong register mappings in the MIN TL-XH2 profile.**
  Checked against the Growatt VPP protocol specification and a field scan from
  @Richardmarkink. Three of the four were inherited from the first-generation MIN TL-XH
  profile rather than introduced by me, but all four shipped in v1.2.1.

  | Register | Was | Actually |
  |---|---|---|
  | 31204/31205 | charge power (W) | **cumulative charge energy (kWh)** |
  | 31208/31209 | discharge power (W) | **cumulative discharge energy (kWh)** |
  | 31215 | battery current, single INT16 | **INT32 spanning 31215-31216** |
  | 31222 | battery temperature | reserved — temperature is at **31223** |

  The energy ones are unambiguous once the values are read as kWh: the field scan gives
  4.0 and 5.3 kWh daily, 37.9 and 29.2 kWh cumulative, on a system with 72.7 kWh of
  lifetime generation. As watts — 37.9 W, 29.2 W — they are nonsense.

  The current one is the same defect reported for WIT in **#247**, where −27.4 A appeared
  as −0.1 A. Reading an INT32 as INT16 returns only the high word, which is ~0 for any
  normal current. Verified here: battery power 2012 W over 403.7 V is 4.98 A, and 31216
  reads 49 → 4.9 A.

- **Known gap: battery temperature may still read 0 on TL-XH2.** The specification puts it
  at 31223, which is what this release uses — but that register reads 0 on the MIN
  4200TL-XH2, while 31224 ("reserved for maximum battery temperature") reads 36.5 °C.
  Mapping the reserved register on a hunch is how the earlier mistakes happened, so it is
  left alone pending a comparison against the app.

- **PV generation energy counters are not exposed over VPP at all.** The VPP input
  register table ends at 31599 and contains only *battery* energy — there is no Etotal or
  Etoday. That is why a scan taken while the inverter displayed 72.7 kWh / 7.5 kWh matched
  no register. Those sensors cannot be provided for VPP-only hardware from this range.

---

## v1.3.2

> ⚠️ **Pre-release.** Changes how every sensor entity is constructed. Please confirm the
> integration loads and your sensors still have values before this is promoted.

Completes the `common-modules` Bronze rule. **No user-facing behaviour changes intended.**

- **New `GrowattEntity` base class.**
  Every entity repeated the same three things: storing the config entry, composing a
  unique ID as `{entry_id}_{key}`, and returning `coordinator.get_device_info(...)`.
  That last one existed **22 times**, differing only in how the device type was derived.

  Migrated so far: the sensor platform (one class, ~200 entity instances) and the binary
  sensor. The 20 control classes in `number.py`, `select.py` and `time.py` are unchanged
  and still inherit `CoordinatorEntity` directly — mixed inheritance is safe, and
  splitting the migration keeps any failure diagnosable.

  **Unique IDs are unchanged.** Each migrated class passes the same key it used before,
  so the composed ID is byte-identical. That matters — `unique_id` is the anchor the
  v0.6.7 entity-ID migration relies on, and changing it would orphan every entity.

- **`available` is deliberately not shared.** Only the sensor platform overrides it,
  gating on `coordinator.is_online` as well as `last_update_success` so sensors go
  unavailable rather than holding stale values (#357). Controls should stay settable
  while a read is failing, so `CoordinatorEntity`'s default is right for them.

### What to check

1. The integration loads and sensors have values.
2. Entity IDs and history are intact — if unique IDs had changed, entities would appear
   as new and lose their history. Spot-check one long-running energy sensor.

---

## v1.3.1

> ⚠️ **Pre-release. Please confirm the integration loads before this is promoted.**
> These are internal plumbing changes that could not be verified locally — Home Assistant
> is not installed in the development environment, so `py_compile` and the 188-unit
> test suite are the only automated checks that ran. Neither can tell you whether the
> integration still *starts*.

Phase 3 of the quality plan. **No user-facing behaviour changes intended** — no sensor,
entity ID, option or value should differ.

- **Per-entry state moved to `runtime_data`.**
  The coordinator now lives on the config entry itself rather than in the shared
  `hass.data[DOMAIN]` dictionary. That dictionary held two unrelated things — the
  coordinators *and* the cross-entry shared-connection registry — which is why code that
  walked it needed a defensive "skip anything that isn't a coordinator" check.

  `hass.data[DOMAIN]` now holds only `_connections`, which is genuinely cross-entry and
  correctly belongs there. Two new helpers in `diagnostic.py` resolve coordinators for the
  service handlers, which receive an entry id rather than an entry.

  Closes the `runtime-data` and part of the `common-modules` Bronze rules.

- **`PARALLEL_UPDATES` declared on every platform.**
  `0` for sensor and binary_sensor: they read from one coordinator poll, so throttling them
  achieves nothing. **`1` for number, select and time** — those *write*, and an RS485 bus
  cannot carry concurrent transactions. That constraint is why `SharedModbusConnection`
  holds a lock at all; declaring it stops HA issuing overlapping calls that would only
  queue on that lock.

### What to check after installing

1. The integration loads and the inverter device appears.
2. Your sensors have values.
3. Controls (numbers, selects, time) still write successfully.
4. The Universal Register Scanner service still runs — its coordinator lookup changed.
5. Download Diagnostics still produces a file.

If anything fails, roll back to v1.3.0 and say so on the issue tracker — a failure here
affects everyone, not one profile.

---

## v1.3.0 — Integration Quality Improvements

No user-facing behaviour changes. This release adds a diagnostics download and a test
suite covering the logic that has caused the most regressions.

- **New: Download Diagnostics**

  *Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → ⋮ → Download diagnostics*

  One click produces a JSON file with the config entry and options, the selected
  profile and register map, coordinator health (online state, consecutive failures,
  whether slow-poll mode is active), client state (backoff, block size, suppressed
  ranges), shared-connection state, and the current decoded values. Host, device path
  and serial number are redacted automatically.

  This does **not** replace the Universal Register Scanner. They answer different
  questions: diagnostics reports what the integration currently *thinks*, and works
  even when every read is failing; the scanner probes what the hardware actually
  responds to, including registers outside the selected profile. Ask for diagnostics
  first, and a scan when register discovery is needed.

- **New: 188-test suite**, run in CI on every push and pull request.

  Every case corresponds to a bug that reached users:

  | Area | Guards against |
  |---|---|
  | Register decoding | v1.2.1 AC power reported as 429,496,471 W — a signed 32-bit value read unsigned (#361) |
  | | Missing registers decoding as `0` instead of `None`, which made a dead link look like a healthy inverter (#357) |
  | Range selection | The three separate ways "is this range fatal on failure?" has been wrong — #357, #361, #364 |
  | Status codes | SPH rendering "Unknown (6)" after being moved off the hybrid table without field confirmation (#363) |
  | | MOD/WIT/TL-XH showing "Self-Test" during normal operation (#348) |
  | Profile registry | Profiles selectable by auto-detection but unrenderable in the options flow, which locked users out of every setting (#360, #361) |
  | | Asymmetric 32-bit pairs and duplicate register names |
  | Connection recovery | The transport-vs-protocol distinction and per-poll budget from PR #365 (#364) |

  Home Assistant is not a test dependency — the protocol layer is HA-free, and the
  suite runs in well under a second.

- **Recorded, not fixed: four pre-existing profile issues** found by the new tests.
  They are allowlisted with explanations so they cannot grow silently, but changing
  which register feeds a sensor alters what users see and needs a field report first.

  The one worth attention: on **SPH/SPM HU**, the BMS registers at 1086-1089
  (`battery_soc`, `battery_voltage`, `battery_temp`) share names with the base
  profile's 1013/1014/1040. Register lookup returns the first match and the base
  block is spread first, so the BMS values — described in the profile as the *actual*
  battery state of charge, and the reason the HU profile exists — appear to be
  unreachable. **If you run an SPH/SPM HU, please check whether your battery SOC and
  voltage match your BMS**, and open an issue either way.

---

## v1.2.3

Issues: #361

- **Fix: MIN TL-XH2 active power was exposed as AC Power instead of Grid Power:**
  Register 31100/31101 is **Active Power** (INT32, 0.1 W, positive = export / negative =
  import) per the VPP 2.03 specification. On a **hybrid** that is *net grid exchange*, not
  raw inverter output — the firmware already subtracts battery and load. This is the same
  distinction `mid.py` documents from the #242 scan: the "use Meter Power instead" caveat
  applies only to grid-tied MID models with no battery.

  v1.2.1 shipped it as `ac_power`, so the value appeared under **AC Power** when it belongs
  under **Grid Power**. Now mapped to `power_to_grid`, and `GRID_SENSORS` added to the
  profile so grid import/export entities are created.

  **What changes for you:** the AC Power entity for this profile is replaced by Grid Power
  import/export. A negative reading means importing — @Richardmarkink's −258.6 W was
  258.6 W drawn from the grid while PV charged the battery, which is correct and now
  labelled correctly.

- **Added: reactive power (31102/31103)** as `ac_reactive_power`, in VAR.

  Worth noting for other profiles: `mic.py` and `min.py` currently label this same pair
  `ac_power_*_vpp` with `maps_to: 'ac_power'` and a VA unit. That is wrong — it is reactive
  power in VAR, not apparent or active power. `mid.py` already has it right. The mislabel is
  latent for most users (those profiles read AC power from their base or 3000 range and only
  fall back to VPP if that fails), so it is left unchanged here rather than altered without
  field confirmation — but if your AC Power looks wrong on a MIC or MIN and the legacy ranges
  are failing, that is why.

## v1.2.2

Issues: #364, #361  |  PR: #365

- **Fix: silent connection loss on a single block no longer leaves sensors stuck at zero
  (PR #365 by @roman0803):**
  Since v1.1.8 a failed base-range block on a hybrid profile returns partial data rather
  than `None`. That is correct for permanently dead ranges, but it also meant the
  reset-and-retry recovery from #354 never fired for a *transiently* failed block — that
  check only triggers when the whole poll comes back empty, and a partially-successful poll
  looks like a normal success.

  The result: PV and AC sensors intermittently stuck at `0.0`, sometimes for many polls,
  while grid and battery sensors from other ranges kept updating. No entity went
  unavailable, so it read as "no sun" rather than a connection fault.

  Block reads now distinguish two structurally different failures:

  | Failure | Surfaces as | Action |
  |---|---|---|
  | Transport — socket dropped, frame corruption | raised exception | reset connection, retry once |
  | Protocol — Illegal Function/Address | `isError()` | return no data, **no reset** |

  That distinction matters: several profiles legitimately probe ranges their hardware
  rejects on every poll (#360, #361), so resetting on a protocol refusal would be a
  permanent tax rather than a recovery. A per-poll budget caps recoveries at two, so a
  genuinely dead gateway cannot turn one poll into a chain of TCP reconnects.

  Field-tested 24h+ across a version upgrade and two HA restarts, cross-checked against an
  independent reading of the same inverter.

- **Fix: MIN TL-XH2 AC Power reported 429,496,471 W (#361):**
  The 31100/31101 pair was shipped unsigned in v1.2.1, so a negative reading surfaced as its
  two's-complement value read as unsigned. Now marked signed.

  **This mapping is still unconfirmed.** It was inferred from magnitude, and the V2.01
  specification places AC power at 31102/31103 instead. The signed value now agrees with the
  AC current reading, but if your AC Power disagrees with the Growatt portal, please say so
  on #361.

- **Fix: per-string PV power sensors read 0 when the profile has no power register (#361):**
  MIN TL-XH2 reports per-string voltage and current plus a single combined total, with no
  per-string power registers. PV1/PV2/PV3 Power therefore sat at 0 while their own voltage
  and current sensors showed live values — which reads as a fault rather than a gap in the
  register map.

  Per-string power is now derived from voltage × current whenever the profile defines no
  power register for that string. A real register always takes precedence, so no existing
  profile changes behaviour.

---

## v1.2.1

Issues: #361

- **New profile: MIN TL-XH2 (3-10kW)** — for second-generation TL-XH inverters.

  The TL-XH2 serves **only** the VPP ranges. Legacy 0-124, storage 1000-1124 and the whole
  3000+ block all return `Illegal Function`. The existing MIN TL-XH profile is therefore
  structurally wrong for this hardware: it sources PV and battery from 3000-range addresses
  that don't exist, so those entities stay empty even when the inverter is responding
  normally.

  Select **MIN TL-XH2 (3-10kW)** manually via *Configure → Inverter Series*. It shares
  DTC 5100 with the first generation, so auto-detection cannot tell them apart — if your
  logs show `Illegal Function` on the 3000-range registers, this is your profile.

  **Every mapping was verified against the Growatt portal** by @Richardmarkink on a MIN
  4200TL-XH2, rather than inferred from the V2.01 specification:

  | Register | Confirmed against |
  |---|---|
  | 31011 / 31013 | portal MPPT1 6.3 A, MPPT2 6.7 A |
  | 31109 | portal grid current L1 8.3 A |
  | 31214 / 31217 | app battery voltage and SOC |
  | 31058/31059 | total PV power — two scans an order of magnitude apart, 773.5 W vs 747 W computed and 2854.7 W vs 2843 W computed |

  Two things that would have been wrong had this been built from the shared V2.01 blocks:

  - **The PV block does not match `VPP_V201_PV2_INPUT`.** That block defines 31012/31013 as
    PV1 *power* high/low; on TL-XH2 they are PV2 voltage and current. Unpacking it would
    have reported PV2 voltage as PV1 power — a plausible-looking value that would have been
    silently wrong. The PV registers are defined inline for that reason.
  - **The battery registers are deliberately unsuffixed.** The first-gen profile names them
    `battery_soc_vpp` and similar to stop them being used as fallbacks for its 3000-range
    equivalents. TL-XH2 has no 3000 range, so these *are* the battery sensors — keeping the
    suffixes would have left every battery entity empty.

  PV3 (31014/31015) is included even though it reads zero on the 4200, which is a two-string
  model. The 7-10 kW variants have three strings, and omitting it would silently lose a
  string on every larger unit.

## v1.2.0

Issues: #360

- **New: "Max Register Block Size" option — for gateways that truncate large reads:**
  Some RS485-to-TCP gateways cannot deliver a large Modbus response intact. At 9600 baud a
  125-register response is 253 bytes — roughly **265 ms** of continuous serial data — and a
  gateway whose serial response window is shorter forwards a truncated frame. The client
  then decodes garbage and the byte stream stays misaligned for every subsequent read.

  The symptoms are distinctive once you know them:
  - `ModbusIOException: Unable to decode request` in the log, in bulk
  - `request ask for id=1 but received 0` (or other nonsense unit IDs)
  - entities unavailable or stuck at zero, while the same inverter works fine from other
    software that happens to read smaller blocks

  Diagnosed on @Xybertecnic's SPA 10000TL3 BH-UP behind a PUSR gateway at 9600 baud, where
  the measurements were unambiguous:

  | Block size | Result |
  |---|---|
  | 125 (default) | every range "No response", 1593 decode errors |
  | 25 | still failing — 1040 decode errors |
  | **1** | **storage range returns 59 registers**, decode errors down to 112 |

  **Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → Configure → Max Register Block Size**
  Options are Auto (default, unchanged behaviour), 50, 25, 10, or 1 register.

  This is deliberately an option rather than a profile setting: the limit is a property of
  your RS485 link, not of the inverter model. The same SPA on a faster or better-behaved
  gateway has no such constraint, and baking a low value into the profile would slow down
  everyone on that model to fix one person's cabling.

  Lower values mean more requests per poll and a slower cycle — use the highest value that
  works. `1` is the most compatible and the slowest.

- **Confirmed: the SPA profile's register map is correct.** Once reads got through intact,
  the existing mapping produced sensible values — battery 424.6 V, SOC 84 %, temperature
  32 °C, work mode 6. No profile change was needed; the data was always there.

---

## v1.1.10

Issues: #361

- **Fix: "Unknown error" when saving options, on an entry that failed to reload:**
  Reported by @Richardmarkink. Changing a setting saved the change, then failed the form
  with a bare `Unknown error` — leaving the user to retry a save that had already applied.

  The options flow reloads the integration after saving. That reload was unguarded, and
  `async_reload()` raises `OperationNotAllowed` when the entry is in a non-recoverable state
  such as `FAILED_UNLOAD` — which happens when a poll is wedged on an unresponsive gateway
  and holds the connection past the unload timeout. The exception propagated to the UI.

  The reload is a convenience, not part of saving: settings are already persisted before it
  runs. It is now wrapped, and a failure logs a warning explaining that the settings are
  saved and will apply after a manual reload or restart.

---

## v1.1.9

Issues: #361

- **Fix: auto-detected TL-XH inverters were locked out of the options flow entirely:**
  Reported by @Richardmarkink. Opening **Configure** to change something unrelated — scan
  interval, for example — failed to save with:

  > value must be one of ['MIC (0.6-3.3kW)', … 'WIT (4-15kW)']

  Auto-detection assigns `tl_xh_3000_10000_v201` for DTC 5100, but that profile had **no
  entry in `PROFILE_DISPLAY_NAMES`**. The options form resolves the stored profile to a
  display name to pre-select it; with no entry, the lookup fell through to the profile's
  technical `name`, which isn't a valid dropdown key — so validation rejected the form
  before any change could be saved. Every option was unreachable.

  Four profiles were affected, all reachable via auto-detection:
  `tl_xh_3000_10000`, `tl_xh_us_3000_10000`, `tl_xh_3000_10000_v201`,
  `tl_xh_us_3000_10000_v201`.

  Two new dropdown entries cover them — **TL-XH (3-10kW)** and **TL-XH US (3-10kW)**.

- **Two guards so this cannot recur silently.** This was the same defect as the missing SPA
  entry in v1.1.6, so an audit of all 32 profiles now runs at import and logs a warning for
  any that no dropdown entry can reach (currently none). Separately, the options flow now
  detects an unrenderable default and falls back to a valid one with a warning, rather than
  presenting a form that cannot be saved. Your configured profile is not changed by that
  fallback — only the value the form pre-selects.

- **Note for MIN TL-XH2 owners — why solar still reads zero.** The `MIN TL-XH (V2.01)`
  profile does not include the VPP PV register block (`31010-31017`), so PV is sourced from
  the 3000-range registers your hardware does not serve. Battery works because that
  profile's battery cluster is read from `31200+`, which does respond. This is not fixed by
  a setting — it needs the dedicated TL-XH2 profile tracked in #361.

---

## v1.1.8

Issues: #361

- **Fix: a dead base range aborted the poll even when the profile had other working ranges:**
  Completes the fix started in v1.1.5. That release stopped the 3000 range from aborting a
  poll when a VPP range was also available — but left the identical flaw in the base range,
  which sits earlier in the read sequence. So on VPP-only hardware the poll still died before
  reaching anything useful.

  Reported by @Richardmarkink on a MIN 4200TL-XH2, who selected the MIN TL-XH (V2.01) profile
  as suggested and still saw every entity unavailable.

  That profile has 104 input registers, 101 of them at 3000+/31000+. But three legacy
  stragglers — 91 and 92 (fallback PV energy) and 97 (boost temperature) — put registers below
  875, so `has_base_range` was true. Base-range failure was unconditionally fatal, so the poll
  returned `None` after failing to read 0-97 and never reached the 31000 block that works.

  A base-range failure is now only fatal when the base range is the profile's **only** source
  of input data. Profiles where that holds — MIC, MID-X, WIT, TL3-S and similar — are
  unchanged and still fail fast. Where other ranges exist, the failure is logged as a warning
  and the poll continues. The empty-cache guard from v1.1.1 still catches "every range failed".

  **Trade-off worth knowing:** a profile with a genuinely dead base range but a working storage
  or 3000 range will now publish partial data instead of going unavailable — real values for
  the ranges that responded, zeros for the ones that did not. This matches how the storage,
  3000, 8000 and 31000 ranges have always behaved; the base range was the sole exception.

- **Note for MIN TL-XH2 owners:** this release should get you PV, AC, grid and status data via
  the MIN TL-XH (V2.01) profile. **Battery sensors will still read zero.** That profile sources
  battery values from 3000-range registers (3169/3170/3171/3176) which your hardware does not
  serve, while its VPP equivalents at 31214/31217/31220 are deliberately suffix-blocked from
  fallback. A dedicated TL-XH2 profile is in progress — see #361.

---

## v1.1.7

Issues: #363

- **Fix: SPH status showing "Unknown (6)" — v1.1.3 regression:**
  Reported by @darimar on an SPH-4600 (V2.01), who had to roll back to v1.1.0.

  v1.1.3 moved SPH and SPH-TL3 off the hybrid status table along with MOD-XH, WIT and
  TL-XH. That was correct for those three — all field-confirmed against ShinePhone — but
  **SPH and SPH-TL3 had no field confirmation at all.** They were changed purely on the
  strength of their register `desc` strings, which claim `0=Waiting, 1=Normal, 3=Fault`.

  Those `desc` strings are wrong for SPH. The standard table has **no entry for 6**, so an
  SPH reporting that state rendered as `Unknown (6)` — the hardware is plainly emitting
  hybrid-range values (6 = "Bat On-Grid", a normal state for a hybrid running off battery
  while grid-connected).

  SPH and SPH-TL3 are restored to the hybrid table. The three field-confirmed families keep
  the v1.1.3 behaviour:

  | Family | Table | Basis |
  |---|---|---|
  | SPH ×5, SPH-TL3 ×2 | **hybrid** (restored) | #363 — value 6 cannot be represented otherwise |
  | MOD-XH | standard | confirmed by @Husplace |
  | WIT | standard | confirmed by @Fyntiker |
  | MIN TL-XH | standard | confirmed by @uspino2 |
  | SPA | hybrid | no `inverter_status` register; falls back to reg 1000 |
  | SPF, SPE | spf | reg 0 carries SPF semantics |

  If you rolled back because of this, v1.1.7 is safe to update to.

  **Note on method:** a profile's `desc` string is documentation, not evidence — several are
  inherited boilerplate never checked against hardware. Status-table changes now require a
  user to report the raw register value alongside what ShinePhone shows. That requirement is
  recorded in `const.py` so this isn't repeated.

---

## v1.1.6

Issues: #360

- **Fix: the SPA profile could not be selected at all:**
  The SPA (AC-coupled storage) profile has existed since #249 with a full register map, but
  it was never added to `PROFILE_DISPLAY_NAMES` — the dictionary that populates the profile
  dropdown. It was therefore unreachable through the UI, and SPA owners had no way to select
  it. Reported by @Xybertecnic, who correctly spotted that the option they expected wasn't
  there.

  **SPA (AC Storage) 3-6kW** now appears in the Inverter Series dropdown.

- **Fix: running the Universal Register Scanner knocked the integration offline:**
  Every TCP entry owns a `SharedModbusConnection` holding a persistent socket, but the
  scanner opened its **own** client. The gateway therefore saw two concurrent sessions from
  Home Assistant — plus any third-party controller on the same bus. Cheap RS485-to-TCP
  adapters accept very few sessions and drop or mis-route responses when exceeded.

  The symptom was distinctive and misleading: every range in the scan fails with
  `BrokenPipeError`, the resulting CSV reports "No response" for everything, and all entities
  go unavailable at the same moment — which reads like the inverter not supporting any
  registers, when in fact the connection was simply being fought over.

  The scanner now takes the hub lock for the duration of the scan and closes the
  coordinator's socket first, so exactly one connection to the gateway exists while it runs.
  Polling resumes automatically afterwards. If a poll is genuinely stuck, the scan now fails
  with a clear message after 60 s instead of producing a CSV full of phantom failures.

  **If you have previously submitted a scan showing everything as "No response", it is worth
  re-running it on this version** — the earlier result may say more about connection
  contention than about your inverter.

---

## v1.1.5

Issues: #361

- **Fix: VPP-only inverters aborted the poll before reading the range that works
  (regression in v1.1.1):**
  Surfaced by @Richardmarkink on a MIN 4200TL-XH2 with an APX HV2.0 battery. A register
  scan showed the legacy ranges (0-124, 1000-1124, all of 3000+) returning *Illegal
  Function* while the VPP ranges — 30000-30499 holding and 31000-31199 input — returned
  live data.

  v1.1.1 treated the 3000 range as a profile's sole data source whenever the profile had
  no base range, and made a total failure there abort the poll. That is correct for plain
  MIN/MOD profiles, but V2.01 profiles carry **both** 3000+ and 31000+. On hardware that
  serves only the VPP range, the poll aborted before ever reaching 31000+ — so a profile
  that would otherwise have produced partial data produced nothing.

  Before v1.1.1 the 3000 failure was suppressed and 31000+ was still read. This restores
  that fall-through while keeping the v1.1.1 behaviour where it belongs:

  ```python
  _3000_is_primary = not has_base_range and not has_31000_range
  ```

  The 3000 range is only the sole source when the profile has neither a base range nor a
  VPP range. The empty-cache guard added in v1.1.1 remains the safety net for "every range
  failed", so nothing can publish zeros as valid data.

  Plain MIN/MOD profiles define no 31000 range, so they are unaffected and still fail fast
  — the #357 fix is preserved.

- **Note for MIN TL-XH2 owners:** auto-detection maps DTC 5100 to the
  `tl_xh_3000_10000_v201` profile, which includes legacy base registers your hardware does
  not serve — the poll fails and every entity goes unavailable. As a workaround, select
  **MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 (V2.01)** manually; it reads the 3000+ and 31000+ ranges without
  the base range, so PV, AC, grid, load and status should populate. Battery data will not:
  the VPP battery range (31200+) does not respond on this hardware, and where it actually
  lives is still unknown. A dedicated TL-XH2 profile is tracked in #361.

---

## v1.1.4

Issues: #358

- **Fix: false "Write reversion detected" warnings when a write lands mid-poll:**
  Reported with a full root-cause analysis by @alanmk (SPH 3600 driven by Predbat, which
  writes every 5 minutes). Any controller that writes on a fixed cadence eventually collides
  with an in-flight poll and trips this.

  `_fetch_data()` assembles its snapshot over several seconds. A write landing during that
  window is not reflected in the snapshot, so the detector compared the tracked value
  against registers read *before* the write and reported the pre-write value as a
  "reversion". Worse, the entry was popped on that first mismatch, so the write was never
  re-checked and could never be vindicated — a guaranteed false alarm, plus the
  once-per-session persistent notification.

  The signature was distinctive: every false warning reported an age of 0–2 seconds, and the
  "reverted to" value was always the previous locally-written value. HA recorder history
  confirmed the writes had actually held.

  Three changes:
  - **Poll timestamping.** `_async_update_data()` now records `poll_start` before the reads
    begin. Any tracked write newer than that is left pending and evaluated on the next poll,
    which genuinely post-dates it.
  - **Debounce.** A write must mismatch on two consecutive polls before being reported. A
    real cloud or firmware revert persists; a timing artefact vanishes on the next poll.
  - **Expiry raised and scaled.** The old flat 120 s could not confirm a genuine reversion
    even at the 60 s default, since confirmation can now need three cycles. It is now
    `max(240 s, 4 × scan interval)`, so slow-polling setups get their reversions confirmed
    rather than silently expired. Based on the configured interval, not the temporary
    offline slow-poll interval.

  Genuine cloud overrides are still detected — they persist across polls and are reported on
  the second mismatch, with an accurate age.

---

## v1.1.3

Issues: #348

- **Fix: status reported as "Self-Test" instead of "Normal" on SPH, SPH-TL3, MOD-XH and WIT:**
  Completes the fix started in v1.0.4 (MOD X) and v1.1.2 (MIN TL-XH). Field-confirmed by
  @Fyntiker (WIT 8k-HU) and @Husplace (MOD 6000TL3-HU EU), both showing *Self-Test* in Home
  Assistant while ShinePhone reported *Normal*.

  `HYBRID_STATUS_CODES` never described the register the `status` sensor actually renders.
  The sensor shows `data.status`, populated from the register named `inverter_status` —
  address 0 on every hybrid family, 3000 on MIN TL-XH V201 — and every one of those profiles
  documents it as `0=Waiting, 1=Normal, 3=Fault`. The hybrid table describes two *different*
  registers that never reach `data.status`:

  | Register | Name | Goes to |
  |---|---|---|
  | 31000 | `equipment_status` | `data.equipment_status` |
  | 1000 | `system_work_mode` | not read as status (except SPA — see below) |

  So value `1` — plainly *Normal* — was decoded through the hybrid table as *Self-Test*. The
  code family was being chosen by inverter **type** rather than by which register the value
  came from.

  `PROFILE_STATUS_MAP` is now near-empty by design. Profiles are only listed when their
  status genuinely does not come from reg 0/3000 with standard semantics:

  | Profile | Table | Why |
  |---|---|---|
  | `SPA_3000_6000_TL_BL` | `hybrid` | Defines no `inverter_status`; falls back to min_addr = reg 1000 (`system_work_mode`), which really is the hybrid register |
  | `SPF_3000_6000_ES_PLUS` | `spf` | Reg 0 carries SPF semantics |
  | `SPE_8000_12000_ES` | `spf` | **Changed from `hybrid`** — SPE inherits SPF's input registers wholesale, so reg 0 is SPF semantics, not hybrid |
  | everything else | standard | Reg 0/3000, standard semantics |

- **Fix: SPE status codes were being decoded with the hybrid table:**
  Found while tracing the above. `SPE_8000_12000_ES` inherits `SPF_3000_6000_ES_PLUS`'s
  `input_registers` (including `inverter_status` at reg 0 with SPF meanings) but was mapped
  to `hybrid`. An SPE in PV Charge (value 5) displayed as *PV On-Grid*; Discharge (2) showed
  as *Reserved*. Now uses the SPF table.

- **Added `5 = Standby` to `STATUS_CODES`:**
  WIT and SPH-TL3 both document this state on register 0. Without it those families would
  have rendered `Unknown (5)` after moving off the hybrid table. Harmless for families that
  never emit it.

  If you have an SPH, MOD-XH, WIT or SPE, your status sensor should now match what ShinePhone
  reports. Please open an issue if it doesn't.

---

## v1.1.2

Issues: #348

- **Fix: MIN TL-XH status reported as "Self-Test" instead of "Normal":**
  A normally-operating MIN TL-XH showed its status as *Self-Test*. Reported by @uspino2
  (MIN 6000TL-XH) — the same root cause as the MOD5000TL3-X report earlier in #348, which
  was fixed for MOD only in v1.0.4.

  There are two separate status registers with different meanings:

  | Register | Name | Semantics |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0 (or 3000 on V201 profiles) | `inverter_status` | 0=Waiting, **1=Normal**, 3=Fault |
  | 31000 | `equipment_status` | 0=Waiting, **1=Self-Test**, 5=PV On-Grid, … |

  The `status` sensor renders `inverter_status`, but chose its decode table from
  `PROFILE_STATUS_MAP` based on inverter *type* rather than on which register the value
  actually came from. All TL-XH profiles were listed as `hybrid`, so value `1` — plainly
  documented as *Normal* in each profile's own register definition — was decoded through
  the hybrid table as *Self-Test*.

  Fix: removed the five MIN TL-XH profiles from `PROFILE_STATUS_MAP` so they use the
  standard codes their registers actually carry (`TL_XH_3000_10000`,
  `TL_XH_US_3000_10000`, `TL_XH_3000_10000_V201`, `TL_XH_US_3000_10000_V201`,
  `MIN_TL_XH_3000_10000_V201`).

  **Known remaining issue:** the same mismatch exists for every other profile still mapped
  to `hybrid` — SPH, SPH-TL3, MOD-XH and WIT all read `inverter_status` from register 0
  with standard semantics documented. Those are deliberately left unchanged for now: there
  are no field reports for them, and WIT/SPH-TL3 document an extra `5=Standby` state that
  the standard table doesn't contain, so switching them blind would replace one wrong label
  with another. If your SPH/MOD-XH/WIT status looks wrong, please open an issue with what
  ShinePhone reports alongside it — that's the field data needed to fix it properly. The
  correct long-term fix is to select the code table by register provenance, mirroring how
  `grid_connection_status` already gates on `equipment_status_valid`.

---

## v1.1.1

Issues: #343

- **Fix: MIN/MOD inverters stuck reporting all zeros until manual reload (regression in v1.0.10):**
  On profiles whose input registers live entirely in the 3000 range — every MIN and
  MOD-family profile — a single failed read of that block put it into the 5-minute
  "optional range" suppression window introduced in v1.0.10 (#351). Because the 3000 range
  is the *only* input range on these profiles, suppression left the register cache empty
  and every value decoded to 0. `read_all_data()` returned that zeroed result instead of
  `None`, so the coordinator treated the poll as successful: entities stayed *available*
  showing 0, the failure counter never incremented, and no reconnect or adaptive backoff
  ever ran. The state re-armed every 300 s and persisted indefinitely — only reloading the
  integration recovered it. Most visible as the overnight Waiting → Normal transition not
  being picked up in the morning.

  Three changes:
  - Retry suppression is no longer applied when the 3000 range is a profile's primary
    (only) input range. Multi-inverter setups keep the anti-log-flood behaviour.
  - A total failure of a primary range now returns `None`, so the coordinator marks the
    inverter offline and runs its reconnect/backoff path.
  - Added a universal guard: an empty register cache after all reads reports the poll as
    failed rather than publishing zeros as valid data.

  **Behaviour change:** on a genuine communication failure, sensors now go *unavailable*
  rather than reading 0. This is the correct Home Assistant semantic — the statistics
  engine ignores unavailable states but records 0 as a real measurement, which previously
  polluted energy history with false zeros.

- **Fix: MOD charge/discharge SOC controls on DO1.0 firmware (#343):**
  Added holding registers 3048 (`batt_first_charge_stopped_soc`) and 3067
  (`grid_first_discharge_stopped_soc`) to the MOD 6000-15000TL3-XH profile. Registers
  1091 and 1071 are dead on DO1.0 firmware — writes are accepted but have no effect,
  and the whole 1060-1099 range reads back zeros. The 3000-range equivalents work
  correctly. Confirmed by @Rohde2026 and @TimOsth.

- Per-block "Successfully read N registers" logging moved from INFO to DEBUG. It fired on
  every register block of every poll, burying genuine warnings in the HA log.

## v1.1.0

Issues: #322

- **New: SPE 8000-12000 ES grid-tie export sensors:**
  Added grid export energy sensors for the SPE 8000-12000 ES single-phase hybrid inverter:
  - **Energy to Grid Today** — input reg 45, single 16-bit register, 0.1 kWh resolution
    (confirmed per Off-Grid Protocol V0.26; prior implementation incorrectly used a 32-bit pair)
  - **Energy to Grid Total** — input regs 46/47, 32-bit pair, 0.1 kWh resolution

- **New: SPE 8000-12000 ES grid-tie export controls:**
  Full grid-tie export control suite for the SPE 8000-12000 ES, validated via field data
  from nicauswu (Issue #322). All controls are SPE-only (gated by `only_profiles` guard).

  **Select controls:**
  | Control | Register | Options |
  |---|---|---|
  | PV Energy Priority (SUB Mode) | 116 | BLU / LBU / LUB |
  | Grid Export Enable | 115 | Disabled / Enabled |
  | Battery Export Enable | 118 | Disabled / Enabled |
  | Grid Compliance Region | 117 | Asia / Europe / South America / South Africa / South Africa (Alt) |

  **Number controls:**
  | Control | Register | Range | Unit |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Grid Export Power Limit | 119 | 0–12 | kW |
  | Max Battery Export Current | 120 | 0–280 | A |
  | Battery Export Stop Voltage | 121 | 42–54 | V |
  | Battery Export Resume Voltage | 122 | 44–56 | V |
  | Min Battery SOC to Export | 123 | 5–90 | % |
  | Battery SOC Resume Export | 124 | 15–100 | % |

  **Corrections based on field validation:**
  - Output priority labels corrected to LCD acronyms: BLU (Battery-Load-Utility),
    LBU (Load-Battery-Utility), LUB (Load-Utility-Battery)
  - Grid compliance region (reg 117) expanded to include value 7 (South Africa Alt)
    which appears on some hardware. This register is firmware-determined and writes
    may be rejected by the inverter.
  - Max battery export current capped at 280 A (hardware limit confirmed on SPE 12000ES;
    protocol spec states 0–400 A)

- **Fix: profile-specific writable register filtering:**
  Register 123 is `export_limit_power` on SPH/XH but `export_min_soc` on SPE. A new
  `only_profiles` / `not_profiles` filter on `WRITABLE_REGISTERS` entries prevents
  cross-profile contamination. The filter is applied in both `number.py` and `select.py`.

## v1.0.14

Issues: #355  |  PR: #354

- **Fix: shared TCP connection never recovers from silent connection drop (#354):**
  Since v1.0.8, all TCP entries route through `SharedModbusConnection`. On a silent drop
  (Wi-Fi blip, NAT timeout, dongle power cycle — no FIN/RST delivered), pymodbus's sync
  client never clears its socket object, so `is_socket_open()` kept returning True and
  `ensure_connected()` reused the dead socket indefinitely. The pre-shared-mode path
  self-healed because it disconnected and reconnected on every poll; shared mode had no
  equivalent recovery path. Fix (contributed by jekmanis/PR #354):
  - `SharedModbusConnection.reset()` force-closes the socket so the next
    `ensure_connected()` opens a real new connection including stale-buffer flush.
  - `_fetch_data_shared()` now calls `reset()` + reconnect + one retry when a poll
    returns no data; if the retry also fails, calls `reset()` again so the next scheduled
    poll starts from a clean socket.
  - Write methods (`write_register`/`write_registers`) now call `disconnect()` on
    transport-level exceptions so writes also self-heal via `ensure_connected()`.

- **New: Insulation resistance, DC injection and leakage current sensors (#355):**
  Three safety-diagnostic registers (3087-3091 in the V1.39/VPP 3000-range) are now
  exposed as disabled-by-default diagnostic sensors on all profiles that have them:
  MIN (grid-tied V2.01), MIN TL-XH, MOD 6000-15000TL3-XH, MID 11-30KTL3-XH.
  | Sensor | Register | Scale | Unit | Notes |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Insulation Resistance | 3087 | 1 | kΩ | PV string isolation to earth |
  | DC Injection Current | 3088 | 0.1 | mA | R-phase (only phase on single-phase models) |
  | DC Injection Current (S-Phase) | 3089 | 0.1 | mA | Three-phase models only |
  | DC Injection Current (T-Phase) | 3090 | 0.1 | mA | Three-phase models only |
  | Leakage Current | 3091 | 1 | mA | GFCI / residual current |

  All five are disabled by default and marked diagnostic. Enable via
  Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → your device → the sensor.
  Particularly useful for correlating RCD / GFCI nuisance trips with the live leakage
  current and insulation resistance values the inverter already measures internally.

## v1.0.13

Issues: #352

- **Fix: backup box sensors now appear on MIN/TL-XH inverters (#352):**
  All 9 backup box sensors (`box_bypass_status`, `box_work_mode`, `box_error_code`,
  `box_warning_code`, `box_temperature`, `box_grid_voltage`, `box_grid_power`,
  `box_load_power`, `box_relay_status`) were missing from Home Assistant despite the
  hardware reporting live data. Root cause: `read_all_data()` cached the 3000-range
  registers correctly but had no code to map them into the `GrowattData` dataclass fields —
  all 10 `box_*` fields remained permanently at their default value of 0. Adds a new
  `_read_backup_box_data()` method that populates all backup box fields from the register
  cache using the existing `_find_register_by_name` / `_get_register_value` pattern.
  Only `box_connect_flag` must be non-zero for the other 8 conditional sensors to appear;
  `box_connect_flag` itself is always created so its value is always visible.

- **Fix: diagnostic scanner correctly identifies MIN/TL-XH when DTC confidence is downgraded (#352):**
  The DTC-based detection correctly identifies a MIN 4200TL-XH as `tl_xh_3000_10000_v201`
  (DTC 5100 → "Very High" confidence). However, when register 30099 reads 0 (legacy
  protocol), confidence is downgraded to "High" to indicate the legacy profile variant should
  be used. The early-return guard checked `confidence == "Very High"` and therefore missed
  the downgraded case, allowing register heuristics to overwrite the correct DTC result with
  "MOD 6000-15000TL3-XH (Hybrid)". Fixed by checking `detection.get("dtc_code") and
  detection.get("profile_key")` instead — any matched DTC always wins over heuristics.

---

## v1.0.12

Issues: #351

- **Fix: eliminate repeated "Skipping..." debug log messages during suppression windows (#351):**
  After the first failure of the 3000-range block (or a VPP optional range), the integration
  suppresses retries for 5 minutes. During this window it previously logged a debug message on
  every single poll ("Skipping 3000-range block... retry in Xs"), producing hundreds of
  identical log lines over a session. The skip is now silent — the initial failure warning and
  the "Retrying..." message at the end of each suppression window provide all necessary context.

---

## v1.0.11

Issues: #336

- **Fix: backup box sensors now appear on MOD/MID hybrid inverters (#336):**
  The MOD 10KTL3-XH-BP and related -XH variants support the Growatt ARK backup box
  (transfer switch) via registers 3281-3342. These registers were present in the TL-XH
  profile but missing from the MOD profile, so no backup box sensors appeared in HA even
  when the box was physically connected (reg 3320=1). Field scan from ledermueller confirmed
  live data on a MOD 10KTL3-XH-BP (box_temperature=33°C, box_grid_voltage=234.0V,
  box_load_power=1089.8W). The fix adds the full 3281-3342 block to MOD_6000_15000TL3_XH
  and enables BACKUP_BOX_SENSORS for the `mod_6000_15000tl3_xh`,
  `mod_6000_15000tl3_xh_v201`, and `mid_11000_30000tl3_xh_v201` profiles.

---

## v1.0.10

Issues: #351

- **Fix: Remaining transaction ID mismatches in shared connection mode (#351):**
  A single buffer flush after acquiring the lock cleared bytes already in the TCP buffer,
  but RS485 bytes still in transit through the gateway arrived milliseconds later — after
  the flush but before the first request, causing the occasional TID mismatch that survived
  v1.0.9. Fix: double-flush with a 30ms pause between flushes, giving in-flight RS485
  bytes time to arrive so the second flush catches them.

- **Fix: 3000-range register block warning flood in multi-inverter setups (#351):**
  In a setup with two different inverter models (e.g. SPH + MOD), the 3000-range register
  block may be defined for one profile but consistently rejected by the other inverter.
  Every failed read logged a WARNING every ~70 seconds. Fix: the 3000-range block now uses
  the same skip-on-failure caching as the VPP 31000+ blocks — the first failure logs a
  WARNING once, then the block is skipped silently for 5 minutes before retrying.

---

## v1.0.9

Issues: #351

- **Fix: Remaining transaction ID mismatches in shared connection mode (#351):**
  With a persistent shared TCP connection, late RS485 responses from a previous slave's poll
  could arrive in the adapter's buffer after the lock was released. When the next slave acquired
  the lock and started reading, those stale bytes produced transaction ID mismatches
  ("request ask for id=X but got id=Y"). Fix: the receive buffer is now flushed at the start
  of every locked poll cycle, not just on reconnect.

- **Fix: Shared connection lock timeout with slow/failing register blocks (#351):**
  The 3000-range register block does not have the same skip-on-failure caching as the VPP 31000
  range. A failing 3000-range chunk costs a full TCP timeout (10s) per chunk, and multiple
  failing chunks could push the total poll time past the 30s lock timeout, causing the other
  coordinator to log "Shared Modbus connection busy (lock timeout 30s)" and skip its poll.
  `SHARED_LOCK_TIMEOUT` increased from 30s to 60s to accommodate realistic worst-case poll times.

---

## v1.0.8

Issues: #351

- **New: Shared Modbus connection mode for multi-inverter RS485-to-TCP gateways (Issue #351):**
  When two integration entries point at the same RS485-to-TCP gateway (identical host:port, different
  slave IDs), the integration now automatically shares a single `ModbusTcpClient` TCP socket between
  them instead of opening two independent connections.

  **Why this matters:** Consumer gateways like the USR-DR164 accept both TCP connections but cannot
  correctly demultiplex RS485 responses back to the right session under simultaneous load. The result
  is transaction ID mismatches ("request ask for id=2 but got id=3") and corrupted readings as each
  slave's response is delivered to the wrong TCP session.

  **How it works:** Detection is automatic — no configuration required. At setup, if a second entry
  shares the same host:port as an existing one, both coordinators use the same `SharedModbusConnection`
  hub. All reads and writes are serialized through a `threading.Lock`, ensuring one slave's complete
  request/response cycle finishes before the next begins. A 50ms inter-slave pause is added after
  each poll to let the RS485 bus settle (configurable via `inter_slave_delay` option).

  Recovery: if the connection drops mid-read, the lock is always released (via `finally` block) and
  the hub reconnects + flushes stale buffer bytes on the next poll. Lock acquisitions time out after
  30s to prevent a hung coordinator from blocking others indefinitely.

  Serial connections are not affected (each serial device opens its own file handle; same-device
  multi-slave serial setups are unusual and typically handled by the OS serial stack).

---

## v1.0.7

- **New: Backup Box support (Growatt ARK transfer switch, TL-XH/MIN TL-XH):**
  The Growatt ARK backup box connects via RS485 to TL-X/TL-XH inverters and reports its status
  through the inverter's Modbus interface at input registers 3281-3342.

  Auto-detected via register 3320 (`bBoxConnectFlag`): when the backup box is present and
  communicating, its sensors appear automatically — no config flow option required. If no backup
  box is connected, the register reads 0 and no sensors are created.

  Sensors added to TL-XH, TL-XH US, and MIN TL-XH profiles:
  - **Backup Box Status** — Normal / Abnormal (diagnostic, disabled by default)
  - **Backup Box Work Mode** — Off-Grid / On-Grid / Generator
  - **Backup Box Bypass** — On / Off (bypass switch state)
  - **Backup Box Temperature** — NTC sensor temperature (°C)
  - **Backup Box Grid Voltage** — Grid voltage seen by the backup box (V)
  - **Backup Box Grid Power** — Signed grid power (W, positive = import)
  - **Backup Box Load Power** — Total load power behind the backup box (W)
  - **Backup Box Error / Warning Code** — diagnostic, disabled by default
  - **Backup Box Relay** — Open / Closed (diagnostic, disabled by default)

  All sensors (except Status) are gated on `bBoxConnectFlag == 1` and appear only when the
  backup box is connected. Sensors are assigned to a dedicated "Backup Box" HA device linked
  to the parent inverter.

---

## v1.0.6

Issues: #349

- **Fix: WIT 50-100K-H/HE/HU/A/AE/AU (DTC 5600) auto-detected as MID profile instead of WIT (Issue #349):**
  DTC 5600 covers the large commercial WIT range but was incorrectly routed to
  `mid_15000_25000tl3_x_v201` in the DTC map. The result was a completely wrong sensor set,
  -2738.6°C battery temperature, and broken controls for WIT 100K-HU hardware.

  Fix: DTC 5600 now routes to `wit_29900_50000tl3_xhu` (the WIT 29.9-50K-XHU profile) as an
  interim. This immediately restores correct PV string sensors (4 strings, registers 3-18), all
  8000-range battery sensors (SOC, SOH, voltage, current), and grid/load energy registers.

  Note: VPP battery cluster registers 31200-31399 return "Illegal Function" on WIT 100K-HU
  hardware (confirmed via register scan). `battery_power` and `battery_temp` will show as
  unavailable rather than garbage values. A dedicated WIT 100K-HU profile addressing those
  sensors is planned once additional register data is confirmed (tracked in issue #349).

---

## v1.0.5

Issues: #345

- **Fix: SPF battery power stays wrong sign indefinitely after grid-to-battery transition (Issue #345):**
  The SPF sign correction (issue #174) covers `CHARGING_STATES = {5,6,7,8,9,10}`, but the
  inverter transitions through status **8** (Combine Charge+Bypass) only during the mode switch
  itself. Once the transition completes, the inverter settles to status **12** (PV
  Charge+Discharge), which was explicitly excluded as "ambiguous". With PV >> load in status 12,
  the battery is unambiguously net-charging, but `battery_power` retains its incorrect negative
  sign and no correction fires — leaving the sensor stuck at the wrong value until the
  integration is reloaded.

  Fix: status 12 is now resolved using a power-balance check rather than being skipped outright.
  If PV power exceeds AC load by more than 200 W and `battery_power` is negative, the sign is
  corrected (battery is net-charging). If load exceeds PV by more than 200 W and
  `battery_power` is positive, it is also corrected (battery is net-discharging). Values within
  the 200 W balance margin are left unchanged to avoid flip-flopping when PV ≈ load.

---

## v1.0.4

Issues: #346, #348, #350

- **Fix: WIT Grid Import Energy jitters due to formula calculation instead of hardware registers (Issue #346):**
  The grid import energy sensors (`grid_import_energy_today` / `_total`) use hardware registers
  on SPH and XH-hybrid profiles, but for WIT inverters they fell through to the calculated
  formula `max(0, load − solar + export)`. WIT profiles have dedicated `energy_to_user_today/total`
  registers (8067-8078) that report hardware-measured grid import directly. The result was
  artificial jitter as the formula's three inputs moved independently.

  Fix: `"wit_" in inverter_series` added to the `has_hardware_import` check, routing WIT
  models to the hardware-register path (same as SPH/XH) and bypassing the formula.

- **Fix: MOD 6000-15000TL3-X shows wrong inverter status and spurious PV Energy Total sensor (Issue #348):**
  Two bugs in the MOD X (grid-tied) profile:

  1. **Status codes:** `MOD_6000_15000TL3_X` was erroneously included in `PROFILE_STATUS_MAP`
     with value `'hybrid'`, causing status code `1` to display as *"Self-Test"* instead of
     *"Normal"* on this purely grid-tied inverter. Removed; MOD X now uses the default
     `STATUS_CODES` (0=Waiting, 1=Normal, 3=Fault).

  2. **PV Energy Total sensor:** `PV_DC_ENERGY_SENSORS` (which includes `pv_energy_total`) was
     included in MOD X's sensor group, but the MOD X register map has no backing registers for
     that sensor (registers 91-92 are absent in the grid-tied profile). The result was a
     permanently-zero entity. Excluded `PV_DC_ENERGY_SENSORS` from the MOD X sensor composition.

- **Fix: Battery SOC freezes indefinitely on MIN TL-XH when VPP range is preferred (Issue #350):**
  On MIN TL-XH the VPP protocol suffix (`_vpp`) is used on the 31000-range battery registers
  (e.g. `battery_soc_vpp` at 31217) to prevent them overriding the authoritative 3000-range
  registers. However, `_get_register_value_with_fallback('battery_soc')` with `preferred_range
  = 'vpp'` only searches addresses ≥ 31000. Since no register named exactly `battery_soc`
  exists in that range, it returned `None`, and the `_cached_battery_soc` last-known-good
  value was served forever — freezing SOC for days with no recovery path.

  Fix: after `_get_register_value_with_fallback` returns `None`, the code now iterates **all**
  registers named `battery_soc` regardless of range and uses the first one that has a cached
  value. This covers MIN TL-XH's register 3171 when VPP is the detected range, and ensures
  the warning message only fires when no range at all can serve a value.

---

## v1.0.3

Issues: #337, #341, #342

- **Fix: SPH 3-6kW (DTC 3502) still auto-detects as `sph_8000_10000_hu` due to floating PV3 input (Issue #337):**
  The v1.0.2 detection reorder (check PV3 before reg 1086) was correct but incomplete.
  On 2-string SPH 3-6kW inverters the unconnected PV3 input floats at ~0.1 V, so legacy
  register 11 reads raw `1`. The `> 0` threshold treated this residual as "PV3 present",
  triggering the HU branch.

  Two-part fix:
  1. **Trust V2.01 when readable** — if the V2.01 PV3 register (31018) returns any value
     (including 0), that response is authoritative and the legacy reg-11 fallback is skipped
     entirely. A V2.01 unit with no PV3 correctly returns `0`; reg-11 is never consulted.
  2. **Noise-floor threshold on reg-11** — when the legacy fallback is still needed (V2.01
     range not available), the threshold is raised from `> 0` to `> 30` (3 V at ×0.1 scale).
     Floating inputs read ~1 raw; any genuinely energised PV string reads 300+ under daylight.

- **Fix: Optional VPP range re-logs WARNING every ~5 minutes forever on single-battery SPH/MIN (Issue #341):**
  The retry logic deleted the failure entry before re-reading the range. If the re-read
  failed again, `.get()` returned `None` and the fail count reset to 1, re-triggering the
  WARNING on every retry cycle. The "warn once, then DEBUG" intent was effectively unreachable
  for permanently absent ranges (e.g. battery cluster-2/3/4 on a single-battery unit).

  Fix: the entry is no longer deleted before the retry read. The existing count survives, so
  subsequent failures increment past 1 and log at DEBUG only. The entry is cleared on a
  successful read so the next genuine failure gets its own first-occurrence WARNING.

- **Fix: TOU time writes cross-contaminate sibling registers on back-to-back writes (Issue #342):**
  The atomic FC16 write for SPH and MOD TOU periods read sibling registers (the one not being
  set) from `coordinator.data`, which is up to `scan_interval` (default 60 s) stale. Writing
  start and then end within one poll window caused the end-write to read the old start from
  cache and write it back, silently reverting the start. Predbat and other controllers that
  program start+end ~1 s apart were consistently affected.

  Fix: both `GrowattGenericTime` and `GrowattModTouTime` now perform a fresh hardware read of
  the full register triple/pair immediately before the FC16 write. The cached data is used only
  as a fallback if the fresh read fails.

---

## v1.0.2

Issues: #336

- **Fix: Grid Import Energy Today/Total uses formula instead of hardware register when register reads 0 (Issue #336 follow-up):**
  The hardware-path gate for SPH/XH hybrid models had an `energy_to_user_today > 0` guard.
  When the register legitimately read 0 (no grid import yet that day — common early morning),
  the guard evaluated `False` and the code fell through to the broken formula:
  `load + export − energy_today`. On MOD-XH and other XH hybrids, `energy_today` is MPPT DC
  yield rather than AC output, so the formula produces a non-zero result that rises during
  morning load and then declines as PV output overtakes consumption — a characteristic
  curve entirely unrelated to actual grid import.

  Fix: removed the `> 0` guard. The hardware register is now used unconditionally for
  SPH/XH profiles; zero is a valid reading meaning no grid import has occurred yet today.
  Same fix applied to the `grid_import_energy_total` (lifetime) sensor.

- **Fix: Grid Energy Today/Total (net grid) shows wrong negative value on XH hybrids (Issue #336 follow-up):**
  The `grid_energy_today` and `grid_energy_total` net sensors were independently re-deriving
  grid import using the same broken formula (`load + export − energy_today`) rather than
  reading the hardware `energy_to_user_today/total` registers directly. This meant even
  after `grid_import_energy_total` was fixed to report 740.3 kWh from hardware, the net
  sensor was still computing `327.5 − 1058.5 = −731 kWh` instead of the correct
  `327.5 − 740.3 = −412.8 kWh`.

  Fix: for SPH and XH hybrid profiles, the net sensors now source their import component
  from `energy_to_user_today/total` (the same hardware register the import sensors use),
  not from the formula. Non-hybrid models (MIN, MIC, etc.) continue to use the formula,
  which is correct for those architectures.

---

## v1.0.1

Issues: #339, #340

- **Fix: Battery SOC permanently stuck at 0% after a single VPP read failure (Issue #340):**
  The optional VPP register range (31000+) was latched permanently into a skip-list after a
  single transient read failure. Any inverter that returned a timeout or exception on first boot
  (e.g. network hiccup, slow inverter startup) would never attempt to read VPP battery registers
  again for the entire session, leaving `battery_soc` at 0% until a Home Assistant restart.

  Two-part fix:
  1. **Time-based retry** — the skip-list is now a dict keyed by range address with a
     `(fail_time, fail_count)` value. Failed ranges are retried after 300 seconds. A `WARNING`
     is logged on the first failure; subsequent failures within the window log at `DEBUG`.
  2. **SOC cache** — within the retry window, the last known-good SOC value is served instead
     of 0.0. The `WARNING` message explicitly says the cached value is being used and will
     recover automatically.

- **New: Dry contact relay controls (Issue #339):**
  SPH and MIN TL-X/TL-XH inverters have a hardware dry contact output (relay) that can be
  triggered when PV output crosses a configurable power threshold. The V1.39 protocol exposes
  this via four registers: three writable controls in the holding register range and one
  read-only state register in the input register range.

  New controls (appear automatically when the profile contains the registers):
  - **Dry Contact Enable** (reg 3016) — select entity: `Disabled` / `Enabled`
  - **Dry Contact On Rate** (reg 3017) — number entity: 0.0–100.0%, step 0.1% — power
    threshold at which the relay closes
  - **Dry Contact Off Rate** (reg 3019) — number entity: 0.0–100.0%, step 0.1% — power
    threshold at which the relay opens
  - **Dry Contact State** (reg 3119) — diagnostic sensor (disabled by default): `Off` / `On` —
    current relay state

  Profiles updated: SPH 3-6kW, SPH 7-10kW, SPH 8-10kW HU, SPH-TL3 3-10kW, MIN 3-6kW,
  MIN 7-10kW (and their corresponding V2.01 variants which inherit automatically).

---

## v1.0.0

Issues: #338

- **New: Multi-battery channel support — Battery 2, 3, 4 (VPP V2.01/V2.03):**
  Per VPP V2.03 specification, additional battery channels occupy mirrored 100-register blocks
  at 31300–31399 (cluster 2), 31400–31499 (cluster 3), and 31500–31599 (cluster 4), with
  identical layout to cluster 1 (31200–31299). All three extra channels are now fully implemented
  across the register profiles, reading code, and HA sensor pipeline.

  Each channel exposes 10 sensors per battery: Voltage, Current, Power, State of Charge, State of
  Health, Temperature, Charge Energy Today, Charge Energy Total, Discharge Energy Today, Discharge
  Energy Total. Sensors are disabled by default and only created when the channel's voltage register
  returns a non-zero value at startup (reliable "battery connected" gate — avoids creating dead
  entities for unpopulated channels).

  Profiles updated:
  - **WIT 4-15kW**: Battery 2 (31300–31323) added — commercial installations commonly pair two
    battery stacks.
  - **WIT 29.9-50K-XHU**: Battery 2 (31300–31323) and Battery 3 (31400–31423) added — matches
    the 3-channel (55A×3) hardware specification.
  - **MOD TL3-XH**: Battery 3 (31400–31423) and Battery 4 (31500–31523) added — Battery 2
    was already mapped; now complete for 4-channel configurations.
  - **SPH, TL-XH, SPH-TL3**: Battery 2 register block expanded from 8 registers to the full
    18-register set (added charge/discharge energy today/total, correct paired current registers,
    SOH). Register addresses unchanged; names corrected (`battery2_charge_power` →
    `battery2_charge_energy_today`, temperature moved from 31322 → 31323 per spec).

## v0.9.10

Issues: #333, #336, #337

- **Fix: MOD-XH `Grid Import Energy Today/Total` shows wrong values (Issue #336):**
  The calculated grid import formula (`load + export − energy_today`) is incorrect on MOD-XH models
  because `energy_today` on those profiles is PV DC string energy (due to `use_mppt_energy_today:
  True`), not AC inverter output. The formula omits the battery charge/discharge contribution,
  producing a result inflated by net battery discharge. For example: load 38.7 kWh, export 1.2 kWh,
  PV DC 37.9 kWh → formula gives 2.0 kWh; correct value per energy balance and hardware register
  is 0.8 kWh. The fix: MOD-XH (and any profile with "xh" in its series name) now reads grid import
  from the hardware registers directly (`energy_to_user_today` at 3067/3068 and
  `energy_to_user_total` at 3069/3070), bypassing the calculation entirely. This matches what
  Growatt's own cloud portal reports. The Total sensor discrepancy (1037.90 vs 725.1 kWh) is
  pre-existing HA long-term statistics corruption from before v0.9.9 and requires a manual stats
  reset in HA's energy dashboard — the raw sensor value will now be correct.

- **Fix: SPH time period start/end writes silently revert (Issue #333):**
  SPH firmware rejects FC06 single-register writes to time period start/end registers — the write
  is acknowledged by Modbus but the inverter reverts the value within ~6 seconds. All SPH time
  period controls (AC charge periods 1–3 at registers 1100–1108, Battery First periods 4–6 at
  1017–1025, Grid First periods 4–9 at 1026–1034 and 1080–1088) now use an atomic FC16 write that
  sends all three registers in the triple [start, end, enable] in a single transaction. This matches
  the write behaviour already used for MOD TOU periods, which resolved the same issue on MOD hardware.
  Falls back to FC06 if sibling registers cannot be resolved (e.g. non-SPH profiles that use
  `GrowattGenericTime` for other purposes).

- **Fix: SPH 3-6kW auto-detects as `sph_8000_10000_hu` (Issue #337):**
  The DTC-3502 refinement previously checked register 1086 before checking PV3 string presence.
  Register 1086 responds on all SPH models with a battery (it returns battery SOC on 3-6kW units),
  so the HU branch fired immediately for any 3-6kW SPH with a battery installed, regardless of
  actual model. The detection order is now: (1) check PV3 — if absent return `sph_3000_6000_v201`
  immediately (HU is a 3-string model, so 2-string units are excluded unconditionally); (2) if PV3
  confirmed, check register 1086 to distinguish HU from 7-10kW.

- **Fix: DTC display names corrected for WIS/WIT commercial models:**
  Per VPP V2.03 specification: DTC 5601 is WIT 29.9-50K-XHU (not "WIT 100KTL3-H"); DTC 5800 is
  WIS 210K (not "WIS 215KTL3"). Updated in `diagnostic.py`, `auto_detection.py`, `wit.py`, and
  `docs/developer/protocol-vpp.md`.

- **New: WIT 29.9-50K-XHU profile (Issue #338):**
  New dedicated profile `wit_29900_50000tl3_xhu` for the 5-variant WIT XHU commercial hybrid series
  (29.9K / 30K / 36K / 40K / 50K-XHU). DTC 5601 now correctly maps to this profile instead of the
  MID grid-tied profile. Hardware confirmed from manual: 4 MPPT trackers (50 d.c.A×4 / 40 d.c.A×4),
  3 battery channels (55A×3), 200-900V battery range, off-grid capable, three-phase 3P3W+PE/3P4W+PE.
  The profile inherits the full WIT register set and adds PV3 (registers 11-14, universally confirmed
  pattern) and PV4 (registers 15-18, inferred from sequential pattern — pending hardware register scan
  verification). PV3/PV4 energy today/total registers at 67-74 follow the WIT per-MPPT energy tracking
  pattern. PV4 sensors are disabled by default and gate on a non-zero voltage reading. The per-MPPT
  `energy_today` sanity limit is raised from 100 kWh to 1000 kWh to accommodate 50 kW 4-string
  commercial systems on high-production days. Battery channel 2/3 registers require Modbus
  documentation (not in manual) — to be addressed when register documentation becomes available.

## v0.9.9

Issues: #335, #336

- **Fix: ENERGY_GUARD false-zeroes WIT 15K daily sensors after gateway reconnect (Issue #335):**
  The stale-data debounce logic contained a `hours_since_midnight × 2 kWh/h` heuristic to detect
  stale daily totals after a wake-up event. For high-output systems (WIT 15KTL3 produces 70+ kWh/day),
  this correctly classifies a legitimate 50 kWh mid-afternoon reading as "too high" and resets all
  daily energy sensors to 0, permanently corrupting that day's stats. The heuristic is removed;
  only an exact match against yesterday's final value is used as a stale indicator.

- **Fix: ENERGY_GUARD spike threshold too low for WIT 15K (Issue #335):**
  The 20 kWh spike-rejection threshold blocked legitimate first-reads after a gateway reconnect on
  high-output profiles. WIT profiles now use an 80 kWh threshold (their full daily production is
  the maximum realistic single-poll reading, and genuine word-tear glitches produce values in the
  thousands of kWh).

- **Docs: WIT DTC 5603 confirmed (Issue #335):**
  Register 30000 = 5603 on a WIT 15KTL3 hardware unit confirmed by community contributor Wojak129.
  This DTC was already mapped in auto-detection since v0.0.7-beta4 — this is independent field
  confirmation. Added to protocol-vpp.md DTC table with source note.

- **Docs: Registers 30407/30408/30409 are EEPROM-safe ("Not storage"):**
  The VPP V2.03 spec explicitly marks these as "Not storage" — they bypass non-volatile memory
  and are safe for high-frequency automation (e.g., updating charge/discharge power every minute).
  Register 30408 = 0 means unlimited/continuous control with no automatic timeout. Documented in
  wit-guide.md.

- **Docs: VPP export limitation section added to wit-guide.md:**
  Registers 30200–30208 now documented including the 5000W legacy register 203 grid compliance cap
  explanation, VPP standby hazard table, and note that 30208 is not used by WIT/WIS models.

- **Fix: MOD/MID-XH `Grid Import Energy Total` missing (Issue #336):**
  Registers 3069/3070 (`energy_to_user_total_high/low`) were absent from `mod.py` despite 3067/3068
  (daily) and 3071–3074 (grid export) being present — a clear omission in the 3067–3074 block.
  Without these registers the coordinator fell back to VPP 31120/31121, which returns a different
  (inflated) value on MID 15KTL3-XH hardware and oscillates due to non-atomic word reads, causing
  the `total_increasing` HA sensor to show backward steps and corrupt the energy dashboard.
  Adding 3069/3070 restores the stable 3000-range source (matching the register scan value) and
  eliminates the drops.

- **Hardware contributor credit:** [@Wojak129](https://github.com/Wojak129) — WIT 15KTL3 field
  testing, DTC 5603 confirmation, register scanning, official VPP protocol documentation obtained
  from Growatt service (Poland), and safety limit discovery that led to v0.9.8 safety fixes.

## v0.9.8

Issues: #335

- **Safety fix: WIT `vpp_export_limit_power_rate` (reg 30201) clamped to 0–100% (Issue #335):**
  The entity previously allowed negative values (−100 to +100%). On WIT hardware, writing a
  negative value to register 30201 while VPP is active triggers **warning 401** and puts the
  inverter into a fault state requiring a service technician reset. The minimum is now 0%
  (zero export). Negative values are not valid export throttle commands on this hardware.

- **Fix: WIT `Export Limit (W)` number entity removed (Issue #335):**
  Holding register 203 is not writable on WIT inverters — writes are rejected with an
  application-level error even when `control_authority`, `vpp_export_limit_enable`, and
  `remote_power_control_enable` are all enabled. The misleading writable entity has been
  removed. The register continues to be polled and its value is available in coordinator
  data. Existing stale entities are cleaned up automatically on upgrade.

---

## v0.9.7

Issues: #331

> **Note:** WIT TOU schedule entities are new and untested on hardware.
> Please report any write failures or unexpected inverter behaviour on issue #331.

- **Improvement: WIT TOU period start/end times use proper HA time pickers:**
  Start and end time entities for TOU periods 1–10 are now `TimeEntity` instances showing a
  native HH:MM time picker, replacing the previous number inputs that required entering
  minutes since midnight (e.g. 480 for 08:00). Existing v0.9.6 number entities are
  automatically removed from the entity registry on upgrade.

---

## v0.9.6

Issues: #331

> **Note:** WIT TOU schedule entities are new and untested on hardware.
> Please report any write failures or unexpected inverter behaviour on issue #331.

- **Feature: WIT VPP Time-of-Use schedule controls (Issue #331):**
  The WIT profile already had TOU period registers mapped (30411–30441) but no Home Assistant
  entities to control them. Ten periods are now exposed with entities per period:
  - **Start time** — HH:MM time picker (v0.9.7+); previously minutes since midnight
  - **End time** — HH:MM time picker (v0.9.7+); previously minutes since midnight
  - **Power level** — signed percentage (−100% to +100%; negative = discharge, positive = charge)
  - **Active period count** (reg 30411, 0–20) — already existed; now accompanied by period entities

  Setting a period with a negative power value during peak tariff hours forces the inverter to
  cover household load from battery, achieving zero grid import safely within grid regulations.
  Periods are written using FC16 (Write Multiple Registers). Periods must not overlap.
  Profile extended from 5 periods (30412–30426) to 10 periods (30412–30441).

---

## v0.9.5

Issues: #316, #320, #324, #332

- **Fix: `inverter_status` entity shows energy total value instead of status code (Issue #316):**
  The data extraction code used `min_addr` (the lowest register address in the profile) as the
  status register address, relying on the implicit assumption that the status register is always
  the profile's first register. This assumption holds for current profiles but is fragile.
  The status is now looked up by name (`inverter_status` or `status`) via `_find_register_by_name`,
  eliminating the assumption and making status reading robust to any future register ordering.

- **Fix: WIT `vpp_export_limit_w` write rejected by inverter (Issue #320):**
  The WIT inverter returns Modbus exception 1 (Illegal Function) when register 203 is written
  with FC06 (Write Single Register). Register 203 requires FC16 (Write Multiple Registers).
  The write now uses `write_registers` instead of `write_register`.

- **Fix: SPH TL3 battery charge/discharge energy sensors always 0 on V2.01 profile (Issue #324):**
  The battery register range detection function (`_detect_battery_register_range`) used a hardcoded
  list of sensor names to score which register range (VPP 31000+ vs fallback 1000+) contains
  active data. The list included `battery_discharge_today_low` and `battery_charge_today_low`,
  but the SPH TL3 profile names these registers `discharge_energy_today_low` and
  `charge_energy_today_low` (no `battery_` prefix). The fallback range scored 2 instead of 4,
  the VPP range won (score 3), and daily energy was read from the 31000+ range where those
  registers don't exist — returning 0.0. The alternate names are now included in the scoring
  list. The data-reading code already handled both names; only the range detection was wrong.

- **Fix: WIT `battery_voltage_bms` 10× too high on standard BMS firmware (Issue #332):**
  The v0.9.4 scale change (0.1 → 1) for register 8095 corrected readings for DIY JK BMS units
  (which report in whole volts) but broke OEM BMS firmware (YE1.0 etc.) that follows the
  standard Growatt 0.1 V/LSB convention. The scale is reverted to 0.1 and the integration now
  auto-detects whole-volt BMS firmware at runtime: if the BMS-reported voltage is less than 20%
  of the inverter's own battery voltage reading (register 8034), it is automatically multiplied
  by 10. Both firmware variants are now handled correctly with no user configuration required.

---

## v0.9.4

Issues: #311, #323, #326, #327

- **Feature: MIN TL-XH priority mode control (Issue #311):**
  Register 3018 (`tl_xh_priority_mode`) hardware-confirmed on MIN 4200TL-XH: write 0 → Load First, 2 → Battery First, 3 → Grid First (default). Appears as a select entity under the Battery device on `MIN_TL_XH_3000_10000_V201` profiles. Note: value 1 is not a valid priority mode on this hardware (V1.39 maps it as a system topology setting).

- **Fix: WIT `battery_voltage_bms` reads 1/10th of actual (Issue #323):**
  Register 8095 (`battery_voltage_bms`) on WIT inverters with JK BMS returns whole volts (e.g., raw 54 at 54.0 V). The previous `scale: 0.1` was producing readings of 5.4 V. Scale corrected to `1`.

- **Fix: WIT `solar_total_power` spikes to 429 MW (Issue #323):**
  The WIT `pv_total_power` 32-bit register pair (regs 1–2) was missing `signed: True`. When the
  inverter sends a small negative value (e.g. at night or during certain grid conditions), it was
  read as an unsigned 32-bit integer — `0xFFFFFFFF × 0.1 = 429,496,729.5 W`. Now correctly
  resolves to approximately −0.1 W.

- **Fix: WIT `vpp_export_limit_w` entity always shows Unknown (Issue #323):**
  Holding register 203 (`export_limit_w`) was defined in the WIT profile but never polled or
  stored in the data object. The number entity read from a field that was never populated.
  Register 203 is now read each poll cycle and stored in `data.export_limit_w`.

- **Fix: Grid import/export and load sensors missing on SPH 3/6kW and 7/10kW (Issue #326):**
  Power-flow registers 1015/1016 (`power_to_user`), 1021/1022 (`power_to_load`),
  1029/1030 (`power_to_grid`), and 1037/1038 (`self_consumption_power`) were present in
  `SPH_8000_10000_HU` and the V2.01 profiles but missing from the two base profiles
  `SPH_3000_6000` and `SPH_7000_10000`. Without them, grid sensors fell back to a derived
  value that reported ~2.6 kW export when the inverter was actually importing. Both base
  profiles now include the full power-flow register set.

- **Fix: Spurious WARNING log before every control write (Issue #327):**
  The integration intentionally closes the Modbus socket after each read cycle. When a
  write is requested, `is_socket_open()` correctly returns `False` and the code reconnects
  before writing — this is by design, not a fault. The "Socket not open, attempting
  reconnect" message has been downgraded from `WARNING` to `DEBUG`.

---

## v0.9.3

Issues: #317, #319

- **Fix: TCP receive buffer flush on reconnect (Issue #317):** RS485-to-TCP adapters can buffer stale Modbus responses from a previous connection session. After an HA restart, pymodbus starts with a fresh transaction counter; the adapter's buffered old responses (with high IDs from the prior session) caused repeated transaction ID mismatch errors on every register read until the buffer drained naturally. The integration now drains the adapter's receive buffer immediately after each `connect()` call, clearing stale responses before the first request is sent.

- **Fix: Grid Connection Status shows Unknown on WIT inverters (Issue #319):** The WIT profile was missing VPP register 31000 (`equipment_status`), causing the sensor to fall back to the legacy `inverter_status` code. The fallback logic only recognised V2.01 codes (5/6/7/8) and not the legacy codes (0=Waiting, 1=Normal), so WIT inverters always showed "Unknown". Fixed by adding register 31000 to the WIT VPP profile, and improving the fallback mapping for any profile without register 31000 (0/1 now maps to "On-grid").

## v0.9.2

Issues: #311 (PR)

- **Feature: Battery First and Grid First SOC limit controls on MIN TL-XH (PR #311):**
  Two new writable number controls are now available on MIN TL-XH profiles (registers
  confirmed against the V1.39 protocol document):
  - `batt_first_charge_stopped_soc` (holding 3048, 0–100%): SOC level at which the inverter
    stops charging the battery when running in Battery First mode.
  - `grid_first_discharge_stopped_soc` (holding 3067, 1–100%): SOC level at which the inverter
    stops discharging the battery when running in Grid First mode. Note: V1.39 marks this
    register as US-model only, added in firmware ZACA-08/UEAA-09.
  - `batt_first_charge_power_rate` (holding 3047, 1–100%): the charge power rate control
    previously available on MOD/MID profiles is now also enabled for TL-XH.

- **Feature: Grid Connection Status sensor (PR #311):**
  A new text sensor `grid_connection_status` is available on hybrid profiles that include the
  VPP equipment status register (31000): SPH, SPM, MOD, MIN TL-XH, WIT, SPA, SPE, MID V2.01.
  Reports On-grid (status codes 5–6), Off-grid (7–8), Unknown, or Offline. Appears under the
  Grid device.

## v0.9.1

Issues: #299, #302, #303, #304, #305, #306, #307, #313

> ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE — affects all users.** `Grid Export Power` and `Grid Import Power` have had their values swapped in all previous versions. After upgrading, each will read the opposite direction to before. Swap any automations, dashboard cards, or Energy Dashboard slots that reference either sensor. Users with **Invert Grid Power** enabled should also disable it (Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → Configure) — it was incorrectly enabled by the setup wizard's auto-detection in previous versions.

**New profiles:**

- **Growatt 3000–15000TL3-S (Issue #299):**
  Added support for the TL3-S three-phase grid-tied string inverter (3–15 kW, legacy protocol).
  Register layout confirmed from a full device scan: PV inputs at regs 3–8, total AC power at reg 12,
  per-phase output (R/S/T) at regs 16–25, temperature at reg 32, and energy at regs 53/55 (×0.1 kWh).
  Auto-detected via DTC 2049 at holding register 43. No VPP support — holding register 30000 returns
  Illegal Function. Note: regs 9–10 contain firmware version bytes (not PV2 power); use the
  Total PV Power sensor rather than PV2 Power.

- **MIC 2500–5500MTL-S (Issue #304):**
  Added support for the MIC 2500–5500MTL-S single-phase dual-string grid-tied inverter family
  (2.5–5.5 kW, legacy V3.05 protocol). Inherits the MIC 600–3300TL-X register map with a second
  PV string confirmed at regs 7–8. Auto-detected via DTC 210. Note: this inverter rejects any
  Modbus read of more than one register at a time — the `max_block_size: 1` mode introduced in
  this release handles this automatically for all sensor reads.

- **MID Hybrid (11–30kW) (Issue #313 / PR #314):**
  MID 11–30KTL3-XH and MID 8–15KTL3-XHL/JP share DTC 5400 with MOD 3–10KTL3-XH and use identical
  register layouts. A named manual-selection option ("MID Hybrid (11–30kW)") is now available in the
  profile dropdown for MID users who prefer the MID label. Auto-detection continues to route DTC 5400
  to the MOD Hybrid profile, preserving entity IDs for existing users.

**Fixes:**

- **Breaking fix: `grid_export_power` and `grid_import_power` swapped on all profiles (Issue #302):**
  Both always-positive derived power sensors had inverted formulas in all previous versions.
  On hybrid profiles (SPH, MOD, WIT) the symptom was visible: during grid import,
  `grid_export_power` showed the import magnitude while `grid_import_power` read zero.
  On grid-tied string inverters (MIN, MIC, MID), `grid_export_power` silently read zero and
  `grid_import_power` carried the export value under the wrong name.
  The signed `grid_power` sensor and all daily energy sensors were unaffected.
  Also fixes the setup wizard's grid orientation detection, which was enabling **Invert Grid Power**
  for the wrong case — inverting when it should not, and not inverting when it should.

- **Fix: MIC 2500–5500MTL-S entities all unavailable (Issue #304):**
  The inverter rejects any Modbus read of more than one register at a time
  (ExceptionResponse FC=132, exception_code=1 — Illegal Function for any block read).
  Fixed by adding per-profile `max_block_size` support to the coordinator. When a profile
  sets `max_block_size: 1`, the coordinator switches to sparse read mode: only the specific
  register addresses defined in the profile are read, grouped into consecutive runs of at most
  1 register, skipping all gaps. This eliminates unnecessary reads for undefined registers.
  All other profiles continue to use the original dense 125-register block reads unchanged.

- **Fix: Inverter Status shows wrong text on hybrid inverters (Issue #305):**
  The status sensor was using a single status code table shared across all inverter families.
  Hybrid inverters (SPH, SPM, MOD, WIT, MIN TL-XH, SPA, SPE) use the VPP Protocol V2.01
  status map where codes have completely different meanings to the grid-tied map — most critically,
  code 5 was shown as "Standby" when the correct label is "PV On-Grid", and code 1 was shown as
  "Normal" when it means "Self-Test" on hybrid models. SPF off-grid inverters have their own
  distinct status set which was also mixed into the same dict.
  Fixed by introducing three separate status code tables (`STATUS_CODES` for grid-tied,
  `HYBRID_STATUS_CODES` for hybrid, `SPF_STATUS_CODES` for off-grid) and selecting the correct
  table at runtime based on the active profile.

  | Code | Grid-tied | Hybrid | SPF Off-Grid |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 0 | Waiting | Waiting | Standby |
  | 1 | Normal | Self-Test | — |
  | 2 | — | Reserved | Discharge |
  | 3 | Fault | Fault | Fault |
  | 4 | — | Updating | Bypass |
  | 5 | — | PV On-Grid | PV Charge |
  | 6 | — | Bat On-Grid | Combined Charge |
  | 7 | — | PV+Bat Off-Grid | — |
  | 8 | — | Bat Off-Grid | — |
  | 9 | — | Bypass | — |

- **Fix: SPH/SPM 8000–10000TL-HU auto-detection fails (Issue #303):**
  DTC code 21303, which identifies the SPH/SPM 8000–10000TL-HU running firmware UL2.21,
  was not in the DTC map. Detection fell through to the legacy register-probing path, which could
  misidentify the high-PV-voltage SPH HU as a MIC micro inverter. On the MIC profile, all battery
  and grid registers are absent, so every power-flow derived sensor was computed from solar
  generation alone. Fixed by mapping DTC 21303 → `sph_8000_10000_hu`.

- **Fix: `house_consumption` returns solar generation on SPH/SPM HU (Issue #303):**
  Two related issues caused `house_consumption` to equal solar on HU firmware UL2.21.
  First, the HU variant does not populate `power_to_load` (register 1021/1022).
  Second, the fallback attempted `self_consumption_power` (register 1037/1038), which on UL2.21
  reports solar-only self-consumption rather than total house load.
  Fixed by removing the intermediate step: when `power_to_load` is absent the integration now
  goes directly to the full energy balance
  (`solar + battery_discharge − battery_charge + grid_import − grid_export`)
  using the direct grid registers (1015/1016 and 1029/1030), which are correct on UL2.21.

- **Fix: Remote Charge/Discharge Power slider rejects negative values (Issue #306):**
  Register 30409 (`remote_charge_and_discharge_power`) accepts −100% (full discharge) to +100%
  (full charge). Negative values must be sent as unsigned 16-bit two's complement over Modbus
  (e.g. −80 → 65456 / 0xFFB0). The code was passing the raw negative Python integer directly to
  pymodbus, which expects an unsigned 16-bit value and raises a struct error. Positive values
  worked because no conversion was needed.
  Fixed by converting signed values to unsigned 16-bit (`value & 0xFFFF`) in `write_register`
  before the pymodbus call. The read-back verification comparison in `write_register_verified`
  is also updated to compare against the unsigned representation.

- **Fix: `energy_today` rises through the night on SPH hybrid inverters (Issue #307):**
  The hardware register for `energy_today` (reg 53/54) on SPH/WIT hybrid inverters counts total
  AC system output, including battery discharge — not solar generation only. The integration
  normally avoids this by summing the per-MPPT DC string registers (`pv1_energy_today +
  pv2_energy_today`), which track PV input only. However, the guard condition checked
  `pv*_energy_today > 0`. After the inverter's daily counters reset to zero at midnight, all MPPT
  values return 0, the guard evaluated `False`, and the code fell back to register 53/54 — which
  then climbed through the night at a rate matching house load (battery powering the house).
  Fixed by gating on register *address existence* rather than *value > 0*. If the profile defines
  per-MPPT energy registers (which all SPH/WIT profiles do), the MPPT sum is always used —
  including when it is zero. Zero at night is the correct value.

- **Fix: MID 15–25kW PV3 missing from base profile (Issue #313):**
  The base `MID_15000_25000TL3_X` profile was missing PV3 registers 11–14. PV3 was previously
  only available on the V2.01 variant via VPP registers 31018–31021. Base register availability
  confirmed from the Issue #313 scan. MID models with a third MPPT string will now show
  `pv3_voltage`, `pv3_current`, and `pv3_power` on both base and V2.01 profiles.

- **Docs: corrected legacy storage register 1000 (uwSysWorkMode) status description:**
  Previously showed `0x05-0x08=Normal`. Updated to list each code individually, matching the
  VPP Protocol V2.01 register 31000 definition.

---

## v0.9.1b6

Issues: #307

- **Fix: `energy_today` rises through the night on SPH hybrid inverters (Issue #307):**
  On SPH (and WIT) hybrid inverters the hardware register for `energy_today` (reg 53/54)
  counts total AC system output, including battery discharge — not solar generation only.
  The integration normally avoids this by summing the per-MPPT DC string registers
  (`pv1_energy_today + pv2_energy_today`), which track PV input only.

  However, the guard condition checked `pv*_energy_today > 0` before using the MPPT sum.
  After the inverter's daily energy counters reset to zero at midnight, all MPPT values
  return 0, the guard evaluated `False`, and the code fell back to register 53/54 — which
  then climbed through the night at a rate matching house load (battery powering the house).

  Fixed by gating on register *address existence* rather than *value > 0*. If the profile
  defines per-MPPT energy registers (which all SPH/WIT profiles do), the MPPT sum is always
  used — including when it is zero. Zero at night is the correct value.

## v0.9.1b5

Issues: #303, #306

- **Fix: Remote Charge/Discharge Power cannot be set to negative values (Issue #306):**
  Register 30409 (`remote_charge_and_discharge_power`) accepts values from −100% (full discharge)
  to +100% (full charge). Writing a negative value requires sending the unsigned 16-bit
  two's complement representation over Modbus (e.g. −80 → 65456 / 0xFFB0). The code was
  passing the raw negative Python integer directly to pymodbus, which expects an unsigned
  16-bit value and raises a struct error. Positive values worked because no conversion was
  needed.

  Fixed by converting signed values to unsigned 16-bit (`value & 0xFFFF`) in `write_register`
  before the pymodbus call. The read-back verification comparison in `write_register_verified`
  is also updated to compare against the unsigned representation, so positive write + verified
  confirmation is correctly reported.

- **Fix: SPH/SPM 8000-10000TL-HU auto-detection fails (DTC 21303 unmapped, Issue #303):**
  DTC code 21303, which identifies the SPH/SPM 8000–10000TL-HU running firmware UL2.21,
  was not in the DTC map. The detection logic could fall through to the legacy register
  probing path, which may identify a high-PV-voltage SPH as a MIC micro inverter. On the
  MIC profile, all battery and grid registers are absent, so every power-flow derived sensor
  (`Grid Export Power`, `Grid Import Power`, `House Consumption`) was computed from solar
  generation alone.

  Fixed by adding `21303 → sph_8000_10000_hu` to the DTC map. Detection now resolves at
  Step 1 (OffGrid DTC) and reaches the correct profile without reaching the register-probing
  fallback.

- **Fix: `house_consumption` returns solar on SPH HU regardless of energy balance (Issue #303):**
  Register 1037/1038 (`self_consumption_power`) on HU firmware UL2.21 reports solar-only
  self-consumption, not total house load. The previous code used it as a direct house load
  proxy when `power_to_load` (register 1021/1022) was zero, causing `house_consumption` to
  equal solar in most operating conditions. The energy balance
  (`solar + discharge − charge + import − export`) was never reached.

  Fixed by removing the `self_consumption_power` intermediate step. When `power_to_load = 0`,
  the integration now goes directly to the energy balance using the direct grid import/export
  registers (1015/1016 and 1029/1030), which are correct on UL2.21.

---

## v0.9.1b4

Issues: #305

- **Fix: Inverter Status shows wrong text on hybrid inverters (Issue #305):**
  The `Inverter Status` sensor was using a single status code table shared across all inverter
  families. Hybrid inverters (SPH, SPM, MOD, WIT, MIN TL-XH, SPA, SPE) use the V1.39 / VPP
  Protocol V2.01 status map where the codes have completely different meanings to the grid-tied
  map — most critically, code 5 was shown as "Standby" when the correct label is "PV On-Grid",
  and code 1 was shown as "Normal" when it means "Self-Test" on hybrid models. SPF off-grid
  inverters have their own distinct status set (0=Standby, 2=Discharge, 5=PV Charge, etc.)
  which was previously mixed into the same dict and would now also collide.

  Fixed by introducing three separate status code tables (`STATUS_CODES` for grid-tied,
  `HYBRID_STATUS_CODES` for hybrid, `SPF_STATUS_CODES` for off-grid) and selecting the correct
  table at runtime based on the active profile. Hybrid status codes are now:

  | Code | Label |
  | --- | --- |
  | 0 | Waiting |
  | 1 | Self-Test |
  | 2 | Reserved |
  | 3 | Fault |
  | 4 | Updating |
  | 5 | PV On-Grid |
  | 6 | Bat On-Grid |
  | 7 | PV+Bat Off-Grid |
  | 8 | Bat Off-Grid |
  | 9 | Bypass |

- **Docs: corrected legacy storage register 1000 (uwSysWorkMode) status description:**
  The protocol-v139 reference table previously showed `0x05-0x08=Normal` for register 1000.
  Updated to list each code individually, matching the VPP Protocol V2.01 register 31000
  definition which was already correct in the docs.

---

## v0.9.1b3

Issues: #304

- **Fix: MIC 2500-5500MTL-S entities all unavailable (Issue #304):**
  The inverter rejects Modbus reads of more than one register at a time (responds with
  ExceptionResponse FC=132, exception_code=1 — Illegal Function for any block read).
  Fixed by adding per-profile `max_block_size` support to the coordinator. When a profile
  sets `max_block_size: 1`, the coordinator switches to sparse read mode: it reads only the
  specific register addresses defined in the profile, grouped into consecutive runs of at most
  `max_block_size` registers, skipping all gaps. This also eliminates unnecessary register reads
  for registers not defined in the profile. All other profiles continue to use the original
  dense read mode (contiguous 125-register block reads) unchanged.

---

## v0.9.1b2

Issues: #299, #303, #304

- **New profile: Growatt 3000-15000TL3-S (Issue #299):**
  Added support for the TL3-S three-phase grid-tied string inverter (3–15 kW, legacy protocol).
  Register layout confirmed from a full device scan: PV inputs at regs 3–8 (PV1 voltage/current/power
  and PV2 voltage/current), total AC power at reg 12, per-phase output (R/S/T) at regs 16–25,
  temperature at reg 32, and energy at standalone regs 53/55 (×0.1 kWh). Auto-detected via DTC 2049
  at holding register 43. No VPP support — holding register 30000 returns Illegal Function.
  Note: regs 9–10 contain firmware version bytes (not PV2 power), so PV2 power stays 0; use the
  Total PV Power sensor instead.

- **Fix: `house_consumption` mirrors solar on SPM 8000TL-HU (Issue #303):**
  The HU variant of the SPH family does not populate `power_to_load` or `power_to_user` registers,
  causing `house_consumption` to collapse to solar power when both are zero (the simple `load = solar`
  fallback). Fixed with a full energy balance fallback: when battery or grid data is present,
  `house_consumption = solar + battery_discharge − battery_charge + grid_import − grid_export`.
  With the HU test case (solar 2389 W, import 2801 W, discharge 501 W) this now correctly
  computes ≈ 5691 W instead of 2389 W.

- **New profile: MIC 2500-5500MTL-S (Issue #304):**
  Added support for the MIC 2500–5500MTL-S single-phase dual-string grid-tied inverter family
  (2.5–5.5 kW, legacy V3.05 protocol). Inherits the MIC 600–3300TL-X register map with PV2
  voltage and current confirmed at regs 7–8. PV2 power pair at regs 9–10 is included but
  unconfirmed — if the PV2 Power sensor shows an unrealistic value, those registers contain
  firmware version bytes and should be reported via the issue tracker.
  Auto-detected via DTC 210 at holding register 43. Note: this inverter rejects multi-register
  Modbus block reads — use `block_size=1` with the Universal Scanner service.

---

## v0.9.1b1

Issues: #302

We apologise for this one. The `Grid Export Power` and `Grid Import Power` sensors have had
their values swapped since they were introduced, meaning every user has been seeing export
labelled as import and vice versa. The bug was in the formula that splits the signed grid power
value into its two always-positive halves — the positive and negative parts were extracted into
the wrong sensors. The signed `Grid Power` sensor and all daily energy sensors were unaffected
because they use a different code path. We only caught it because a user noticed the symptom
on a hybrid inverter where both directions are active (Issue #302). Grid-tied string inverter
users (MIN, MID, MIC) were also affected but the symptom was less obvious — those inverters
only export during the day, so `Grid Export Power` silently read zero while `Grid Import Power`
carried the export value. Both are now correct.

> ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE — affects all users.**
> `Grid Export Power` and `Grid Import Power` were swapped in all previous versions.
> After upgrading, these sensors will read the opposite value to before.
> If you have automations, dashboards, or energy dashboard slots referencing either sensor,
> you must swap them. The signed `Grid Power` sensor and all daily energy sensors are unaffected.
> Users with **Invert Grid Power** enabled should also disable it (Settings → Devices &
> Services → Growatt Modbus → Configure) — it was incorrectly set by auto-detection in
> previous versions and is no longer needed for standard inverters.

- **Breaking fix: `grid_export_power` and `grid_import_power` swapped on all profiles (Issue #302):**
  The two always-positive derived power sensors had their formulas inverted in all previous
  versions. `grid_export_power` was extracting the import portion of the signed grid power
  value and `grid_import_power` was extracting the export portion — the opposite of their names.
  On hybrid profiles (SPH, MOD, WIT) the symptom was visible: during grid import,
  `grid_export_power` showed the import magnitude while `grid_import_power` read zero. On
  grid-tied string inverters (MIN, MIC, MID) the inverter only exports, so `grid_export_power`
  silently read zero and `grid_import_power` showed the export value under the wrong name.
  The signed `grid_power` sensor and the daily energy sensors (`Energy to Grid Today`,
  `Grid Import Energy Today`) were unaffected — they read from separate register addresses.

- **Fix: `invert_grid_power` auto-detection was inverting the wrong case:**
  The setup wizard's grid orientation detection returned the wrong result — it enabled inversion
  when it detected positive = export (the correct convention) and disabled it when it detected
  negative = export (the case that actually needs correction). This caused some users to have
  `invert_grid_power` incorrectly set to True, which negated the signed `grid_power` sensor
  so it showed negative while exporting. Auto-detection is now correct. Existing users with
  the flag incorrectly enabled should disable it via Configure.

---

## v0.9.0

---

- **Fix: Universal Scanner DTC registers showing as zero on fresh TCP connection:**
  The DTC identification registers (holding 30000 and holding 43) frequently returned 0 in
  scan output even though `read_register` always worked. The scanner opens a new raw TCP
  connection that displaces the coordinator's session; the inverter returns 0 until it settles.
  Fixed with a post-connect warmup delay and end-of-scan settled re-reads — by the time the
  full range scan completes, several seconds have elapsed and the inverter's Modbus state is
  stable. Also fixes garbled firmware version (holding 9-11) from the same cause.

- **Fix: VPP battery charge/discharge today swapped on SPH V2.01 profiles (Issue #300):**
  `battery_charge_today` and `battery_discharge_today` from VPP registers 31202 and 31206
  were labelled the wrong way round on `sph_3000_6000_v201` and `sph_7000_10000_v201`.
  VPP Protocol V2.01 specifies 31202 as daily charge and 31206 as daily discharge — the
  integration had them reversed. The legacy storage-range registers (1052/1053 and 1056/1057)
  were always correct; only the VPP-sourced entities were affected.

- **Feature: Universal Scanner now includes holding register scan (0-124 and 1000-1124):**
  The `export_register_dump` scanner now reads holding registers (FC03) for the legacy base
  range (0-124) and storage/control range (1000-1124) in addition to the existing input
  register scan. These ranges contain writable controls such as `ac_charge_enable` (holding
  1092), TOU time period slots (holding 1100-1108), charge/discharge power rates, priority
  mode, and scheduling windows. Holding register rows appear in the CSV with an H-prefix
  address (e.g. H1092) and a Suggested Match column populated from the active profile's
  register definitions. Holding and input data are kept in separate dictionaries so values
  at the same address do not overwrite each other.

---

## v0.8.9

Issues: #295

---

- **Fix: WIT all entities unavailable after upgrading to v0.8.8 (Issue #295):**
  The profile-driven register scan sizing introduced in v0.8.8 contained a bug affecting WIT
  inverters. Two related problems were found and fixed:
  1. `has_base_range` was checking for any address in 0–999, which includes WIT's 875-range
     registers. This caused `max_base_addr` to resolve to ~998 — a 999-register read that
     immediately exceeded the Modbus limit of 125 per request. Fixed by excluding 875–999
     from the base range check (that range is already read separately).
  2. After the first fix, the base range read was still 189 registers (WIT has input registers
     defined up to address 188). This also exceeds the 125-register limit. Fixed by reading
     the base range in 125-register chunks when it spans more than 125 addresses — the same
     pattern already used for the 3000-range. As a side effect, WIT registers 125–188 are now
     read correctly for the first time (previously the 0–124 cap silently dropped them).

- **Feature: Universal Scanner configurable block size:**
  The `growatt_modbus.export_register_dump` service now accepts a **Block Size** field (125,
  25, or 1 register per request; default 125). Inverters using older RS485 protocols or
  single-register-only firmware (such as the TL3-S family) reject large Modbus block reads
  and return Illegal Function errors for entire ranges. Setting block size to 25 or 1 allows
  these inverters to be scanned successfully, at the cost of scan time.

- **Feature: Universal Scanner always reports both DTC registers:**
  The scan result notification and CSV detection section now always show the raw value of both
  the VPP DTC register (holding 30000) and the legacy V1.39 DTC register (holding 43),
  regardless of which one was used for model identification. Useful when investigating
  inverters with unknown or conflicting DTC codes.

---

## v0.8.8

Issues: #294

---

- **Feature: Configurable inter-request Modbus delay (Issue #294):**
  A new **Modbus Request Delay** field (50–1000 ms, default 250 ms) is available in Options
  (Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → Configure). This controls the minimum
  pause between consecutive Modbus read requests within a single poll cycle. The 250 ms
  interval was already hardcoded internally; this exposes it as a user-configurable setting.
  Users seeing `transaction_id` mismatch errors in the log — caused by the inverter responding
  late to requests while the next one has already been sent — should increase this to 500–1000 ms.
  Takes effect immediately without an integration restart.

- **Fix: Profile-driven input register block sizing:**
  The base (0–N) and storage (1000–N) input register reads now read only up to the highest
  register address defined in the active profile, rather than always reading 125 registers.
  A profile that only uses registers 0–88 now requests 89 registers instead of 125, reducing
  payload size and poll time.

- **Fix: VPP holding register retry throttling:**
  VPP-range holding registers (30100, 30200–30201, 30407–30410) that return no response on
  the first read of a session are now permanently skipped for the remainder of that session.
  This mirrors the existing behaviour for VPP input register ranges and prevents repeated
  unanswered requests from accumulating transaction-ID mismatches on firmware that does not
  implement these registers. On the next HA restart the registers are retried once in case
  firmware was updated.

- **Fix: `priority_mode` sensor displays mode name instead of raw integer:**
  The Priority Mode sensor now shows "Load First", "Battery First", or "Grid First" instead
  of the raw register value (0, 1, 2).

- **Feature: `Export Limit Fallback Power Rate` writable number entity (holding register 3000):**
  A new **Export Limit Fallback Power Rate** number control (0–100%, step 0.1) is available on
  MIN TL-X, MIN TL-XH, MIC 600–3300TL-X, and TL-XH 3000–10000 profiles (and all their V2.01
  variants). It reads and writes holding register 3000 (`ExportLimitFailedPowerRate`) — the
  fallback output power cap the inverter applies when export limitation control fails. Appears
  under the Grid device as a configuration entity.

---

## v0.8.7

Issues: #286, #287, #293

---

- **Fix: `priority_mode` (register 1044) demoted from writable select to read-only sensor (Issue #293):**
  V1.39 protocol specifies holding register 1044 as read-only. The integration incorrectly exposed it
  as a writable select entity on SPH 3–6kW, SPH 7–10kW, and SPH-TL3 profiles, allowing writes that
  the inverter silently ignores or rejects. Register 1044 is now a read-only diagnostic sensor
  (Battery device) on all affected profiles. WIT (register 30476) and MOD (input register 3144) were
  already read-only and are unchanged.

- **Feature: SPH V2.01 remote power control registers (Issue #286):**
  VPP registers 30407–30410 are now exposed on the `sph_3000_6000_v201` and `sph_7000_10000_v201`
  profiles as writable entities. Register 30407 (`remote_power_control_enable`, on/off select),
  30408 (`remote_power_control_charging_time`, 0–1440 min number), 30409
  (`remote_charge_and_discharge_power`, −100 to +100% number), and 30410
  (`vpp_ac_charge_enable`, disabled/PV priority/AC priority select) allow time-limited
  charge/discharge power overrides and AC charging mode control from Home Assistant automations —
  the same capability available in the Growatt SHINE app.

- **Feature: Battery voltage range option in integration settings:**
  A new **Battery Voltage Range** dropdown has been added to the integration's Options flow
  (Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → Configure). Three choices are available:
  *Auto-detect* (default, suitable for most installations), *Standard battery (under 600 V)*
  (forces register 3169 to be read at 0.01 V/unit with no overflow correction), and
  *High-voltage battery (600–950 V, e.g. ARK)* (applies an overflow correction to register 3169
  when its reading is below 100 V — the symptom of a 16-bit overflow on HV systems where
  VPP register 31214 does not respond). Useful when the auto-detection cascade gives an
  incorrect result and the user knows their battery type.

- **Feature: MID TL3-X V2.01 PV3 string sensors added:**
  The `mid_15000_25000tl3_x_v201` profile now includes PV string 3 sensors
  (`pv3_voltage`, `pv3_current`, `pv3_power`) sourced from VPP registers 31018–31021.
  The total PV power register shifts to 31022–31023 (matching the VPP Protocol V2.01
  3-string block layout). The legacy (non-VPP) MID profile is unchanged — PV3 data is
  only available via VPP registers.

- **Fix: MOD TL3-XH battery voltage 10× too high on standard (non-HV) battery systems (Issue #287):**
  v0.8.0 changed register 3169 scale from 0.01 to 0.1 to correct readings on high-voltage ARK
  battery systems (600–950 V). This broke MOD TL3-XH units with standard 200–300 V batteries,
  which store voltage in 0.01 V/unit resolution — producing readings 10× too high (e.g. 2500 V
  instead of 250 V). Register 3169 reverted to 0.01 V/unit scale. VPP register 31214 (0.1 V/unit,
  per VPP Protocol V2.01) added as a higher-priority candidate via the existing max-value selection
  logic: when 31214 responds it correctly covers both HV (600–950 V) and standard-voltage batteries
  regardless of 3169's unit resolution. The battery voltage plausibility ceiling has also been raised
  from 800 V to 1100 V so that valid HV readings are not discarded.

---

## v0.8.5

Issues: #228 · #242 · #284 · #285

---

- **Fix: MOD TL3-X and TL3-XH `ac_power` reported Phase R only (Issue #228):**
  Both profiles had the `alias: 'ac_power_high/low'` on registers 40/41 (Phase R
  output power) instead of registers 35/36 (three-phase total output power). As a
  result `ac_power` always equalled `ac_power_r` regardless of the other phases.
  Alias moved to registers 35/36 in both profiles.

- **Fix: Midnight ENERGY_GUARD incorrectly retained previous-day small daily totals:**
  After HA midnight the daily retention dict is cleared. The first poll (typically
  7 seconds later) catches the inverter before it has reset its own counters
  (~30–90 s after HA midnight). Daily totals under the 20 kWh spike threshold
  (e.g. `charge_energy_today`, `load_energy_today`) were being accepted into
  retention as legitimate new-day values. When the inverter subsequently reset them
  to 0, the retention logic held the stale yesterday values for the rest of the night.
  At sunrise the hardware value rose past 0 and the guard silently dropped retention,
  causing a backward step on `total_increasing` sensors and HA recorder warnings.
  Fixed by opening a 10-minute grace window at midnight during which any non-zero
  daily total with no prior retention is suppressed to 0. The inverter's own reset
  always completes within this window; genuine new-day accumulation starts cleanly
  after it expires.

- **Feature: Inverter clock drift detection and HA notification:**
  On the first successful connection each HA session the coordinator reads the
  inverter's system time registers (VPP 2.01: holding 30104–30109;
  V1.39/OffGrid: holding 45–50) and compares to HA system time. If the absolute
  drift exceeds 5 minutes a persistent HA notification is created explaining the
  impact on daily energy counters and how to correct the inverter clock.

- **Breaking change: MID TL3-X grid export/import now sourced from Meter Power register (Issue #242):**
  `grid_export_power` and `grid_import_power` on MID grid-tied models (MID 15–50KTL3-X,
  MID 20–30KTL3-X2, MOD/MID-X3 series — DTC 5001/5002) previously read from VPP Active Power
  register 31100/31101, which is the inverter's own 3-phase AC output. For a grid-tied inverter
  without a built-in CT clamp this overstated export (inverter output vs. actual grid exchange).
  Grid export/import now correctly sources from VPP Meter Power register 31112/31113, which
  reflects the value measured by a connected Growatt smart meter or datalogger. **If you have no
  external smart meter**, these entities will read 0 — use `ac_power` or `solar_total_power` for
  inverter output monitoring instead. Hybrid models (SPH, MOD-XH, WIT) are unaffected: their
  Active Power register already carries net grid exchange computed by the hybrid firmware.

- **Fix: Daily energy totals drop to 0 then show backward steps after mid-day inverter reconnect (Issue #284):**
  When the inverter briefly goes offline mid-day (grid disturbance, fault recovery, peak shaving)
  and comes back online, the wakeup handler was unconditionally clearing ENERGY_GUARD retention.
  The first post-reconnect poll would read 0 for daily counters (inverter not yet done
  repopulating its registers), and with no retention to hold the previous value the sensor
  dropped to 0. Subsequent polls recovered to a value slightly below the pre-offline reading,
  causing a backward step and HA `total_increasing` recorder warnings. Fixed by gating the
  retention clear on time of day: retention is only cleared on wakeup before 10:00 (morning
  startup where stale-value detection is needed). Mid-day wakeups preserve retention so
  ENERGY_GUARD continues protecting against transient 0-reads. The morning stale-value
  detection path (Issue #225) is unaffected — `_handle_midnight_reset()` already clears
  retention at midnight before the inverter comes online.

- **Fix: DTC code 5001 misdetected as MIC instead of MID (Issue #242):**
  DTC 5001 was absent from the detection map, causing MID 17–25KTL3-X and related grid-tied
  MID/MOD-X models to fall through to MIC micro-inverter profile detection. All missing DTC codes
  from Growatt VPP 2.03 protocol Table 3-1 have been added: 5001/5002/5003 (MID/MOD/MAC-X
  grid-tied series), 5600/5801 (large WIT/WIS commercial), 3503/3504 (SPH HU/HUB variants),
  3701/3715/3716 (SPA AU/AUB/BL variants). Users who were manually selecting a profile to work
  around wrong auto-detection can re-run auto-detect after updating.

- **Fix: Lifetime energy totals show brief backward step after HA restart (Issue #285):**
  `energy_total`, `charge_energy_total`, `discharge_energy_total` and similar lifetime counters
  are persisted to HA storage so they survive restarts. Previously the save was dispatched as a
  background task; if HA restarted before the task executed, the storage held the value from the
  previous poll cycle. On restart HA briefly displayed the older value before the next live poll
  corrected it, causing a `total_increasing` backward-step warning in the recorder. Fixed by
  awaiting the storage write directly after each poll where retention values change, so storage is
  always current within the same event-loop tick. The HA `Store` debounces disk I/O internally,
  so this adds no meaningful overhead.

---

## v0.8.4

---

- **Debug: `[ENERGY_GUARD]` diagnostic logging added to energy protection (Issue #228):**
  The daily energy counter protection logic now emits searchable `[ENERGY_GUARD]`
  log entries at DEBUG level. Each poll logs whether a daily total was accepted,
  retained (hardware reported 0), or spike-rejected. The wake-up retention-clear
  event logs the discarded values before wiping them. The stale-value debounce
  window now logs `energy_to_user_today` alongside `energy_today`. Enables root-cause
  diagnosis of gradual overnight accumulation followed by a morning drop-to-zero on
  inverters that stay partially online at night (e.g. MOD12-KTL3-HU). To enable,
  set `custom_components.growatt_modbus: debug` in your HA logger config and
  search logs for `ENERGY_GUARD`.

---

## v0.8.3

---

- **Fix (Issue #283): SPH 3–6kW and 7–10kW battery registers corrected:**
  Input registers 13–19 in the 0–124 base range were incorrectly named as battery
  registers (`battery_voltage`, `battery_current`, `battery_power`, `battery_soc`,
  `battery_temp`, `bms_type`). Per V1.39 protocol those addresses are PV3–PV5 channel
  registers (power H/L words for additional PV strings). Battery data is exclusively in
  the storage range: discharge power (1009–1010), charge power (1011–1012), battery
  voltage (1013), SOC (1014), battery temperature (1040). All six wrong definitions
  removed; registers 1013 and 1040 added. V201 override that shadowed the old spurious
  `battery_soc` at register 17 also removed.

---

## v0.8.2

---

- **Fix: `set_battery_mode` service was a registered no-op (F-001/F-002):**
  The VPP battery-mode write logic had been spliced into `get_register_data` by
  mistake, leaving `set_battery_mode` as a function that only logged one line and
  returned. The `_read()` closure and return payload belonging to `get_register_data`
  had been appended to `sync_tou_schedule`, causing a runtime NameError on the
  success path. All three function bodies restructured so each contains only its
  own logic.

- **Fix: `services.yaml` field mismatches corrected (F-006/F-007):**
  Three phantom services (`read_inverter_data`, `test_connection`,
  `update_register_map`) removed — they were documented but never registered.
  `set_battery_mode` fields restored (`device_id` selector + `mode` + `power_percent`).
  `write_registers` fields corrected (`register` + `values`).
  `sync_tou_schedule` no longer has orphaned `write_registers` fields at the end.

- **Fix: Holding register reads omitted slave/unit ID (F-003):**
  `read_holding_registers()` now passes `slave_id` using the same try/except
  compatibility fallback (`slave=`, `unit=`, positional) already used by
  `read_input_registers`. Five direct `client.client.read_holding_registers()`
  calls in `auto_detection.py` switched to the wrapper method.

- **Fix: WIT cooldown timestamp set before write (F-005):**
  `_wit_control_last_write[register]` is now updated only after a confirmed
  successful write. Previously a failed write would still block subsequent
  writes for the full 30-second cooldown.

- **Fix: Binary sensor online state now uses `coordinator.is_online` (F-018):**
  Replaced the 5-minute `timedelta` heuristic with the coordinator's authoritative
  `is_online` property, keeping inverter connection state consistent across all
  platform entities.

- **Fix: Duplicate `modbus_client` property removed from coordinator (F-021):**
  The property was defined twice in `GrowattModbusCoordinator`; the second
  definition shadowed the first silently.

- **Fix: Explicit `disconnect()` added to entry unload path (F-022):**
  `async_unload_entry` now calls `coordinator.modbus_client.disconnect()` via
  executor before removing the coordinator from `hass.data`. Prevents file
  descriptor leaks on integration reload.

- **Docs: `battery-scheduling.md` service examples corrected (F-008):**
  Two `read_register` YAML examples used `register_address` and `count` which
  are not part of the service schema. Fixed to `register`; `count` removed;
  `device_id` moved into `data` block.

- **Feat (Issue #282): WIT holding registers 235–238 exposed as read-only diagnostic sensors:**
  `ntognd_detect` (235), `nonstd_vac_enable` (236), `enable_spec_set` (237), and
  `fast_mppt_enable` (238) are now readable as diagnostic sensors on the Inverter device.
  All four are **read-only** in this integration regardless of the hardware's write
  capability. Registers 235–238 control safety-critical grid-protection and inverter
  behaviour (N-to-GND detection, non-standard grid voltage thresholds, regional spec
  flags, and MPPT aggressiveness). Writing incorrect values can cause grid-code
  violations, hardware damage, or void certification. All four entities are
  `disabled_by_default` and require explicit opt-in to surface in the UI.

- **Fix (Issue #131): `grid_first_discharge_power_rate` range corrected to 1–100%:**
  Register 3036 (Grid First discharge power rate on MOD TL3-XH) was documented
  as 1–255 in the protocol sheet but user-confirmed to be a percentage — values
  above 100 produce an unknown error response from the inverter. The number entity
  range is now clamped to 1–100% to prevent out-of-range writes.

---

## v0.8.1

---

- **Fix: Daily energy spike at inverter startup eliminated (Issue #228):**
  Some inverters write 32-bit register pairs as two separate 16-bit writes.
  During the midnight daily counter reset, reading the pair mid-write produces
  a transient garbage value (e.g. 79 kWh when the true value should be ~0 kWh).
  The coordinator's `_protect_energy_totals` function previously accepted any
  positive reading unconditionally, so the garbage value was stored as the
  day's retained total, causing the sensor to stay at that spike value.
  Added a rate-of-change guard: any daily counter jump larger than 20 kWh in
  a single poll is rejected with a WARNING log entry. The 20 kWh threshold
  is safe for any poll interval and any residential or commercial system size.

---

## v0.8.0

---

- **Fix: MOD TL3-XH battery voltage scale corrected (Issue #228):**
  Register 3169 (`battery_voltage`) scale changed from `0.01` to `0.1`.
  The MOD TL3-XH hardware operates at 600–950 V — a 16-bit register with
  0.01 V resolution overflows above 655 V, making the previous scale
  physically impossible for any battery in this inverter's operating range.
  Affected users saw values ~10× too low (e.g. 73 V instead of 733 V).
  The Growatt V1.39 protocol spec lists 0.01, which applies to lower-voltage
  hardware variants; the XH spec sheet (600–950 V) confirms 0.1 is correct
  for this profile.

- **Feat: MOD TL3-XH battery mode power rate controls (Issue #131):**
  Two new writable holding registers added to `MOD_6000_15000TL3_XH`:
  - `grid_first_discharge_power_rate` (register 3036, range 1–255) — sets the
    discharge power rate when operating in Grid First priority mode.
  - `batt_first_charge_power_rate` (register 3047, range 1–100%) — sets the
    charge power rate when operating in Battery First priority mode.
  Both appear as number entities in Home Assistant under the Battery device.
  Confirmed responding on hardware via scan #228 (3036=100, 3047=80).

- **Refactor: VPP V2.01 shared register block extraction (Phase 3):**
  Introduced `profiles/vpp_v201.py` containing eight shared register block
  dicts (`VPP_V201_STATUS`, `VPP_V201_PV2_INPUT`, `VPP_V201_PV2_TOTAL`,
  `VPP_V201_PV3_AND_TOTAL`, `VPP_V201_ENERGY_1P`, `VPP_V201_TEMPERATURE_1P`,
  `VPP_V201_BATTERY2`, `VPP_V201_HOLDING_1P`) covering registers 30099–30201
  and 31000–31322. These blocks are identical across the SPH, MIN, TL-XH,
  SPH-TL3, and MID V2.01 profiles. Each profile now unpacks shared blocks
  with `**` and keeps only family-specific registers inline.
  Net: −441 lines removed, +273 added (−168 net). No runtime behaviour change.

  Additionally fixed two omissions in the SPH-TL3 V2.01 profile discovered
  during scan evidence review:
  - `ipm_temp_vpp` (31131) and `boost_temp_vpp` (31132) were absent — scans
    251_1/251_2 confirm both registers respond (Read OK). Now included via
    `VPP_V201_TEMPERATURE_1P`.
  - `active_power_rate_vpp` (30114) was absent from holding registers — scan
    confirms it responds (Read OK). Now included via `VPP_V201_HOLDING_1P`.

---

## v0.7.9

---

- **Feat: GitHub Pages documentation site:**
  Full documentation migrated to MkDocs at
  [0xaha.github.io/Growatt_ModbusTCP](https://0xaha.github.io/Growatt_ModbusTCP/).
  Covers supported models, sensor reference, power flow glossary, inverter
  controls, energy dashboard setup, troubleshooting, and developer guides.
  README slimmed to installation essentials with a prominent link to the docs.

- **Feat: Register read and disconnect log messages promoted to INFO:**
  The "Successfully read N registers from M" and "Disconnected successfully"
  messages were previously DEBUG-only, so a successful poll cycle was invisible
  at default log level. Both are now INFO, consistent with the "Successfully
  connected" message that was already INFO. Users can now confirm polling is
  working from the standard HA log without enabling debug mode.

- **Refactor: Template-generated sensor definitions (Phase 2 architecture review):**
  PV string (pv1/pv2/pv3 voltage, current, power) and three-phase AC sensors
  (ac_voltage/current/power_r/s/t, ac_voltage_rs/st/tr) replaced with helper
  functions `_pv_string_sensors()`, `_phase_sensors()`, and
  `_line_voltage_sensors()` in `sensor.py`. Reduces ~100 lines of verbatim
  repetition. A grep-index comment block above the helpers lists all generated
  keys so static analysis tools (including the CI tests) can locate them.
  CI test updated to also parse grep-index comment lines when extracting
  sensor definitions.

- **Refactor: Profile key alias mechanism (Phase 2 architecture review):**
  `PROFILE_ALIASES: Dict[str, str]` added to `device_profiles.py`. Maps
  retired or duplicate profile keys to their canonical replacement, allowing
  profile consolidation without breaking existing config entries.
  `resolve_profile_alias()` helper added; `get_profile()` resolves aliases
  transparently at runtime. Config entries with aliased keys are silently
  updated on startup with an INFO log entry.
  First alias: `mod_6000_15000tl3_xh_v201` → `mod_6000_15000tl3_xh`
  (both keys use `MOD_6000_15000TL3_XH` register map and identical sensors).

---

## v0.7.8

---

- **Feat: INFO-level startup logging in coordinator:**
  On startup the coordinator now logs a single INFO line summarising the active
  profile name, connection string (TCP host:port or Serial path@baud), scan
  interval, and polled register ranges (e.g. `0–124, 1000–1124`).  A second
  INFO line is emitted once device identification completes, showing model,
  serial, firmware, and protocol version.  Useful for confirming the correct
  profile was detected without enabling full debug logging.

- **Feat: CI sensor integrity tests (pytest):**
  Three automated tests in `tests/test_sensor_integrity.py` verify internal
  consistency of the sensor configuration on every push and PR to main:
  1. Every key in `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS` (sensor.py) is assigned to a device in
     `SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP` (const.py).
  2. Every key in a `*_SENSORS` group constant (device_profiles.py) exists in
     `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS`.
  3. `SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP` does not accumulate new undefined-sensor entries beyond
     a tracked allowlist (`KNOWN_MAP_WITHOUT_DEF`).

  A `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` workflow runs these tests on Python 3.12.

- **Fix: Add missing SENSOR_DEFINITIONS for three-phase line-to-line voltages:**
  `ac_voltage_rs`, `ac_voltage_st`, `ac_voltage_tr` were wired end-to-end
  (GrowattData dataclass, coordinator, profiles, THREE_PHASE_SENSORS group,
  SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP) but lacked entries in `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS`, so no sensor
  entities were ever created.  Added as diagnostic voltage sensors.

- **Chore: Remove orphaned SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP entries:**
  `bms_status_old`, `bms_error_old`, `bms_warn_info_old` are superseded legacy
  BMS register variants with no active sensor definitions; removed from the map.

- **Fix: V2.01 profile incorrectly assigned to non-VPP inverters:**
  Before this release, auto-detection used `auto_detected=True` as evidence of
  V2.01 protocol support.  That flag is set for *any* successful detection
  (including plain register probing), so inverters that use only the legacy
  3000-range registers (e.g. MIN 7000-10000TL-X) were silently assigned a
  `_v201` profile and generated `Modbus Error: Illegal Function` every poll cycle.

  **Root cause:** `supports_v201` in the config flow was derived from
  `auto_detected`, not from whether a DTC code was actually read from register
  30000.

  **Fix:** A new `vpp_protocol_confirmed` flag is stored in config entry data.
  It is `True` only when auto-detection successfully read DTC from register 30000
  (confirmed V2.01 hardware).  The manual-selection and reconfigure flows now
  read this flag instead of inspecting the current profile name.

  **Automatic migration:** On startup, `async_setup_entry` detects the
  `_v201`-but-unconfirmed combination and silently downgrades the profile to its
  legacy equivalent.  Affected users will see a one-time WARNING log entry.
  Legitimate V2.01 users (who set up under v0.7.8+) are not affected because
  their `vpp_protocol_confirmed` flag is `True`.

---

## v0.7.7

---

- **Refactor: Composite sensor group constants (phase 1 of architecture review):**
  17 of 28 inverter profiles previously repeated identical 10–13 line sensor union
  expressions verbatim. Three composite constants now capture the common patterns:

  - `GRID_TIED_1P_SENSORS` — single-phase grid-tied base (no battery); used by MIN profiles
  - `HYBRID_1P_SENSORS` — `GRID_TIED_1P_SENSORS | BATTERY_SENSORS`; used by SPH and TL-XH
  - `HYBRID_3P_SENSORS` — same scope as `HYBRID_1P_SENSORS` with `THREE_PHASE_SENSORS`
    replacing `BASIC_AC_SENSORS`; used by SPH-TL3 and MOD-XH

  Profile compositions now read as single expressions, e.g. `HYBRID_1P_SENSORS | PV3_SENSORS`
  instead of a 12-line union. Adding a sensor to a shared cluster is now one line instead of
  up to 8. No entity IDs, sensor keys, or runtime behaviour changed — the resolved sets are
  identical to before. 11 profiles with unique compositions are left as explicit inline blocks.

  Net change: −201 lines in `device_profiles.py`.

---

## v0.7.6

---

- **Refactor: Extract SPE_OFFGRID_SENSORS constant (phase 1 of architecture review):**
  The `spe_8000_12000_es` profile previously used an anonymous inline sensor set for its
  SPF-compatible sensors. This meant any future change to `SPF_OFFGRID_SENSORS` would
  silently not apply to SPE, making the divergence invisible at review time. Extracted to a
  named `SPE_OFFGRID_SENSORS` constant with comments documenting which SPF sensors are
  excluded and why (register overflow, no generator input, remapped registers). No runtime
  behaviour change — the resolved sensor set is identical to before.

- **Audit: SPA duplicate profile key (architecture review Concern C):**
  Confirmed `spa_3000_6000_tl_bl` has a single entry in `INVERTER_PROFILES`. Concern C
  from the architecture review is not present in the current codebase.

---

## v0.7.5

- **Fix: SPH-TL3 `ac_power_s` and `ac_power_t` always showing 0 (Issue #265):**
  On some SPH-TL3 firmware variants, per-phase power registers for phases S and T
  (registers 44/45 and 48/49) return 0 while voltage and current registers for all
  three phases report valid data. Only the phase R power register (40/41) was populated
  — which on this device holds the inverter's total output power rather than a true
  per-phase R value, making the three phase power readings inconsistent.

  **Fix:** The coordinator now reads all three per-phase power registers together and
  checks whether all return valid (non-zero) data. If any are missing or zero, it
  falls back to calculating apparent power (V×I) for **all three phases** so the
  values are consistent with each other. For hardware with fully-functional per-phase
  power registers (e.g. MOD series), this path is never taken and behaviour is
  unchanged. For SPH-TL3 users, `ac_power_s` and `ac_power_t` will now show
  realistic per-phase apparent power values instead of 0.

---

## v0.7.4

---

- **New: Per-string daily and lifetime energy sensors across all compatible profiles (Issue #265):**
  `pv1_energy_today` and `pv2_energy_today` sensors are now created for all profiles that
  support multiple PV strings (SPH, SPH-TL3, MIN, MIC, MOD, WIT, TL-XH). `pv3_energy_today`
  is additionally created for 3-MPPT profiles (MIN 7-10kW, SPH 7-10kW, SPH-HU, MOD, TL-XH),
  but only exposed as an entity when the inverter actually reports non-zero PV3 data.

  `pv1_energy_total` and `pv2_energy_total` (lifetime per-MPPT totals) are now exposed for
  all profiles with legacy registers 59–66: **SPH, SPH-TL3, TL-XH, MOD, WIT**, and **MIN TL-X**.
  MIN TL-X also adds `pv3_energy_total` via its 3000+ range registers (3057–3066). All totals
  are condition-gated and only appear once the inverter reports non-zero data.

- **Fix: Incorrect register mapping for SPH and TL-XH legacy registers 59–62:**
  Registers 59–62 in the SPH and TL-XH profiles were incorrectly labeled as
  `backup_voltage/current/power/frequency`. Scan data confirmed these are actually per-MPPT
  DC energy registers (identical to all other Growatt families): 59/60 = `pv1_energy_today`,
  61/62 = `pv1_energy_total`. No HA entities were ever wired to the old backup names so there
  is no user-visible regression; the fix corrects the underlying register map and enables the
  per-MPPT energy sensors for SPH and TL-XH users.

  All per-string sensors are **disabled by default** — enable them individually in the Home
  Assistant entity registry if you want to track per-string production. Total daily solar
  energy continues to be reported by the existing `energy_today` sensor.

- **Fix: VPP registers 31118–31125 in SPH-TL3 V201 profile had incorrect names and units:**
  These registers were previously mapped as load power (W) and a generic `energy_today`,
  causing confusion with the main energy_today sensor. They now correctly map to:
  - 31118/31119 → `energy_to_user_today_vpp` (kWh, daily energy delivered to loads)
  - 31120/31121 → `energy_to_user_total_vpp` (kWh, lifetime energy delivered to loads)
  - 31122/31123 → `energy_to_grid_today_vpp` (kWh, daily energy exported to grid)
  - 31124/31125 → `energy_to_grid_total_vpp` (kWh, lifetime energy exported to grid)

  These VPP registers are suffixed (`_vpp`) so they do not interfere with the legacy
  protocol registers which take precedence during coordinator data resolution.

- **Fix: Today energy sensors reset to 0 on any HA restart or integration reload:** On
  every cold-start (HA restart or config-entry reload), `_previous_day_totals` is empty
  because it is only populated at midnight during an active session and is never persisted
  to storage. The stale-value debounce introduced in v0.7.3 (Issue #225) always ran on
  the first inverter connection after startup, comparing the inverter's current
  `energy_today` against an effective "yesterday = 0". This produced two classes of false
  positive:

  1. Small legitimate morning values (0 < energy_today < 0.1 kWh) matched the
     "within 0.1 kWh of yesterday" tolerance and were zeroed out.
  2. Large mid-day values on higher-capacity systems (e.g. 18+ kWh by 9 AM on a 15 kW
     system) exceeded the 2 kWh/hour rate heuristic and were also zeroed out.

  In both cases the sensor showed 0 (with the inverter online and `available = True`),
  causing HA long-term statistics to record a spurious counter reset.

  **Fix:** The stale-value debounce window (`_just_came_online_time`) is now armed only
  when `_ever_had_real_data = True` — meaning HA has been running continuously since the
  last midnight reset and `_previous_day_totals` actually holds a real yesterday reference.
  On cold-start, the debounce is skipped entirely; storage-loaded retention already
  protects against glitch zeros, and without a genuine yesterday total the stale check
  produces only false positives.

- **Fix: MIN TL-XH `pv_energy_total` missing on some firmware variants:** On the
  `MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 (V2.01)` profile, the primary PV lifetime energy register
  (`3053/3054`, Epv_total) was not present in the profile definition — meaning
  `pv_energy_total` was always zero or absent. Additionally, some hardware/firmware
  variants that do expose `3053/3054` report `0` there while holding the correct
  accumulated value in the legacy register pair `91/92` (same as TL-XH 0-range layout).

  **Fix:** Registers `3053/3054` are now declared as primary `pv_energy_total_high/low`
  in the `MIN_TL_XH_3000_10000_V201` profile, matching the layout of the MIN grid-tied
  3000-range profiles. Registers `91/92` are declared as `pv_energy_total_legacy_high/low`.
  The reader falls back to the legacy pair only when the primary read returns exactly `0`
  and the legacy registers contain a non-zero value — so genuinely zeroed systems are
  unaffected while firmware variants that use `91/92` get a valid reading.

- **Fix: Condition-gated sensors permanently missing after any HA restart (#262):** The v0.7.3
  fix for issue #255 introduced `async_config_entry_first_refresh`, which seeds
  `coordinator.data` with an empty `GrowattData()` placeholder — without ever reading the
  inverter — so that HA's bootstrap stage completes immediately regardless of inverter
  connectivity. However, sensor and control entity setup runs against this placeholder, so
  any entity whose creation is gated on a runtime-detected hardware attribute (e.g.
  `hasattr(data, 'battery_soh')`) sees no data, fails the check, and is permanently skipped
  for the entire HA session.

  This affected **every startup**, not only ones where the inverter was offline. A fresh
  install with the inverter fully online still produced the same result because the placeholder
  is always seeded before the first poll.

  **Affected entities (examples):** `battery_soh`, `bms_soh`, `battery_voltage_bms`,
  `vpp_export_limit_enable`, `control_authority`, generator sensors, extra temperature
  sensors, and any other entity whose presence depends on a register that is confirmed
  by a live hardware read.

  **Fix:** deferred entity registration. After the initial setup pass, each affected platform
  (`sensor`, `select`) now registers a lightweight coordinator listener. The listener is a
  no-op until `coordinator.has_real_data` becomes `True` (the inverter's first successful
  poll). At that point it re-evaluates the skipped conditions against real data, calls
  `async_add_entities` for any that now pass, and unsubscribes itself. Existing entities are
  never disrupted. The listener is also cleaned up automatically if the config entry is
  removed before the inverter ever responds.

## v0.7.3

Issues: #249 · #253 · #254 · #255 · #256 · #257 · #225 · #259

---

- **SPH-TL3 / SPA — Battery First & Grid First TOU scheduling (#249):** The SPA/SPH-TL3 firmware
  has a full time-of-use schedule with separate windows for Battery First and Grid First modes,
  beyond the 3 AC-charge slots already available. These registers were confirmed via the
  SPH_3000-6000TL-HUB user manual and hardware register scan.

  27 new control entities are now exposed for SPH-TL3 and SPA (which inherits the same register
  map):

  | Slot | Mode          | Start              | End                | Enable             |
  | ---- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
  | 4–6  | Battery First | reg 1017/1020/1023 | reg 1018/1021/1024 | reg 1019/1022/1025 |
  | 4–6  | Grid First    | reg 1026/1029/1032 | reg 1027/1030/1033 | reg 1028/1031/1034 |
  | 7–9  | Grid First    | reg 1080/1083/1086 | reg 1081/1084/1087 | reg 1082/1085/1088 |

  Time slots appear as `time` entities (HH:MM picker); enable toggles appear as `select` entities
  (Enabled / Disabled).

  **Background:** Writes to `priority_mode` (reg 1044) were silently rejected by the SPA firmware
  when all Battery First and Grid First scheduling windows contained zeros. The ShinePhone
  workaround (set all slots to 00:00–23:59) works by populating these window registers. With this
  release, the slots can be configured directly from Home Assistant, eliminating the need for the
  workaround.

- **SPH-TL3 — Power to Load / Grid Power register fix (#257, @TomasHala):** Registers 1021/1022
  (`power_to_user_total`) and 1037/1038 (`power_to_load`) were swapped in the SPH-TL3 profile.
  Grid import power and load consumption are now correctly separated. Hardware-tested on SPH-TL3.

- **SPH-TL3 — New control entities (#256, @TomasHala):** Four additional holding registers added,
  hardware-tested on SPH-TL3. These are already available in the SPH profile and are now exposed
  for SPH-TL3 (and SPA, which inherits the same register map):
  - **Max Output Power Rate** (reg 3) — limits AC output power as % of rated capacity
  - **Export Limit Mode** (reg 122) — enables/disables grid export limiting
  - **Export Limit Power** (reg 123) — export power cap as % of rated capacity
  - **Load First Battery Minimum SOC** (reg 608) — minimum SOC before switching to load-first mode
  - **Battery State of Health** (reg 31218) — BMS-reported battery health percentage (read-only)

- **Translations — 20 languages (#254):** UI config flow and options strings are now available
  in 20 languages. Danish (`da`) was contributed by a community member; the remaining 19 were
  added in this release:

  | Code | Language | Code | Language |
  | ---- | -------- | ---- | -------- |
  | `de` | German | `cs` | Czech |
  | `nl` | Dutch | `hu` | Hungarian |
  | `fr` | French | `ro` | Romanian |
  | `es` | Spanish | `sk` | Slovak |
  | `it` | Italian | `bg` | Bulgarian |
  | `pl` | Polish | `hr` | Croatian |
  | `pt` | Portuguese | `el` | Greek |
  | `sv` | Swedish | `tr` | Turkish |
  | `nb` | Norwegian Bokmål | `ru` | Russian |
  | `fi` | Finnish | `uk` | Ukrainian |

  The English (`en`) file remains the authoritative reference.

- **MIN / TL-XH — Eac Total and Epv Total as separate sensor entities (#253):** Two distinct
  lifetime energy figures are now exposed independently:

  - **Energy Total** (`energy_total`, reg 3051/3052) — Eac: total AC energy the inverter has
    ever delivered to the grid and home loads. On hybrid models this includes battery discharge.
  - **PV Energy Total** (`pv_energy_total`, reg 3053/3054) — Epv: raw DC energy captured from
    the solar panels, measured before the inverter conversion stage. Slightly higher than Energy
    Total due to ~2–7% conversion losses; unaffected by battery charge/discharge cycles.

  `pv_energy_total` is also available on TL-XH (reg 91/92), SPH, SPH-TL3/SPA, WIT, and MOD-XH
  profiles. `energy_total` always reads the AC-output register directly on all profiles — it is
  never replaced or overridden by the Epv figure.

  Register mappings also added to both MIN profiles for PV3 DC string energy (3063/3064 today,
  3065/3066 total) alongside the previously added PV1/PV2 string registers.

  The `energy_today` per-MPPT summation (pv1 + pv2 + pv3 DC strings) is used on hybrid profiles
  (SPH, SPH-TL3/SPA, TL-XH, WIT, MOD-XH) where the AC energy_today register includes battery
  discharge. Pure grid-tied profiles (MIN, MIC) read `energy_today` directly.

- **Sensor descriptions in More Info modal:** Ambiguous or easily confused sensor pairs now
  display a plain-English explanation in the More Info modal (click any sensor tile in the HA
  dashboard). Descriptions cover: Energy Today / Energy Total / PV Energy Total, Solar Total
  Power vs System Output Power, Grid Power (signed) vs Grid Export / Import Power, Battery Power
  (signed) vs Charge / Discharge Power, battery energy accounting (DC charge/discharge vs AC
  charge/discharge vs operational discharge), load and grid energy breakdowns, IPM/Boost
  temperatures, BMS voltage vs inverter-measured voltage, and WIT parallel inverter extra sensors.

- **Offline at startup — integration now loads without blocking HA bootstrap (#255):** Two
  separate startup failure modes are now resolved:

  - **`ConfigEntryNotReady` loop** — if `_fetch_data` returned `None` (inverter not responding),
    the coordinator raised `UpdateFailed` → `ConfigEntryNotReady`. HA retries with exponential
    backoff but can exhaust the retry budget before the inverter comes online (e.g. overnight).
    Fixed: coordinator creates an empty `GrowattData()` placeholder instead of failing.

  - **`CancelledError: Bootstrap stage 2 timeout`** — `async_config_entry_first_refresh` made two
    blocking executor calls (device identification + data read, each with 3 TCP retries). On a
    slow or offline inverter this exceeded HA's global bootstrap timeout, cancelling the setup
    task entirely. Fixed: first refresh now only restores local persisted energy totals (no network
    I/O). Device identification is read lazily on the first successful poll.

  In both cases the integration loads immediately; all sensors show `unavailable` until the
  inverter responds. No manual reload required.

  Also guarded the VPP entity removal logic (`vpp_export_limit`, `control_authority`) against the
  offline-startup case so entities are only pruned when the inverter has actually connected and
  confirmed those registers are absent.

- **Power sensors show `unavailable` when inverter is unreachable (#259):** Previously, power
  sensors (PV power, battery power, grid power, load power, etc.) returned `0 W` whenever the
  inverter was not responding. This is misleading — a TCP adapter keeps the socket open even when
  the RS485 bus to the inverter has no signal, so `0 W` is indistinguishable from a genuine
  zero reading at night.

  Per the HA integration quality scale
  [`entity-unavailable`](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/entity-unavailable)
  and [`log-when-unavailable`](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/log-when-unavailable)
  rules: entities must report `unavailable` when data cannot be fetched (not a synthetic `0`),
  and must log at `INFO` level once on the unavailable→available transition in both directions.
  Power sensors now return `None` (→ `unavailable`) in offline state, consistent with diagnostic
  and energy sensors. Logging now fires once per state transition at `INFO`; repeated per-poll
  errors are demoted to `DEBUG`.

- **Energy Today — stale overnight value persists until sunrise instead of resetting at midnight
  (#225):** The midnight callback correctly cleared the daily retention store. However, if the
  inverter stayed connected through midnight (reporting yesterday's accumulated total before its
  hardware register reset at sunrise), overnight polling would rebuild the retention store with
  the stale yesterday value. When the hardware finally reset to 0 at sunrise the retention
  protection would then prevent the 0 from showing, so the sensor displayed yesterday's total all
  morning.

  Fix: when the inverter comes back online after an offline period, daily total retention is now
  cleared unconditionally (not just on date change) and the debounce window is always enabled.
  When the debounce detects a stale value (matches yesterday's final reading) it resets daily
  totals to 0 and simultaneously clears the retention store so `_protect_energy_totals` cannot
  undo the reset.

## v0.7.2

Issues: #251 · #249 · #245 · #228

---

- **MID/MOD V2.01 — corrected VPP 31100-31113 register mappings (#245, #228):** The VPP 2.01
  protocol specification (confirmed against MID 20KTL3-XH scan data in #245) defines the
  31100-31113 range as:
  - **31100/31101**: Active power INT32 (positive = export, negative = import) — was previously
    mapped as per-phase voltages, which is incorrect. Now mapped as `power_to_grid` fallback.
  - **31105**: Grid frequency (×0.01 Hz) — was unmapped; now mapped as `ac_frequency_vpp`.
  - **31106-31108**: AB/BC/CA line voltages (×0.1V) — were unmapped; now mapped as
    `line_voltage_rs/st/tr` for three-phase line voltage sensors.
  - **31109-31111**: Phase A/B/C currents (INT16 signed, ×0.1A) — were unmapped; now mapped
    as `ac_current_r/s/t`.
  - **31112/31113**: Meter power INT32 (positive = **import** per spec item 55) — was
    incorrectly mapped as `power_to_grid` fallback (wrong sign direction). Now correctly
    mapped as `power_to_user`. This also retroactively fixes the #228 MOD grid power
    "wrong direction" symptom: the old #228 workaround happened to paper over the issue in
    some scenarios, but the root cause was using an import-direction register as the export
    fallback.
  - **31102/31103**: Reactive power INT32 (×0.1VA) — added as diagnostic registers.
  - **31118-31125**: Energy counters (UINT32, 0.1kWh) — were incorrectly mapped as load
    power (31118/31119) and solar energy today/total (31120-31123). Per spec items 60-63
    these are grid import/export energy today/total. Corrected and 31124/31125 (total grid
    export) added. The VPP values act as fallbacks behind the 3000-range energy counters
    (3067-3074) which take priority in the coordinator's multi-range lookup.

- **SPA — additional sensors from extended scan (#249):** Cross-analysis of 15 time-of-day
  scans (09:34–20:41) against energy balance verification confirmed three missing sensors:
  - **Grid import power** (`power_to_user`): register 1021/1022 = PacToUser Total (×0.1 W).
    Confirmed via energy balance: battery_discharge + grid_import = load ✓ at every scan.
    Note: SPH-TL3 uses the same register addresses (1021/1022) for load power — semantics
    differ because SPA measures the grid connection point bidirectionally.
  - **Grid frequency** (`ac_frequency`): register 1113 (×0.01 Hz). Confirmed 49.86–50.00 Hz
    variation consistent with UK grid frequency fluctuation.
  - **Battery current** (`battery_current`): register 1088 (×0.01 A, signed). Confirmed:
    +14.0A during 760W charge (÷54.3V = 14.0A ✓); −58.5A during 3050W discharge
    (÷52.5V = 58.1A ✓). Negative = discharging per HA convention.

- **SPH 10000TL3 BH-UP — wrongly assigned V201 profile (#251):** Devices with DTC 3601 that
  return protocol version 0 from register 30099 (indicating legacy register layout, no V2.01
  support) were occasionally auto-detected as `sph_tl3_3000_10000_v201` instead of
  `sph_tl3_3000_10000`, causing `grid_voltage` and `grid_frequency` to read as zero despite
  the inverter actively exporting power. Two fixes applied: (1) the DTC 3601 refinement step
  in `async_refine_dtc_detection()` now explicitly reads register 30099 and returns the base
  profile immediately if it returns 0, ahead of the general protocol version check; (2) the
  diagnostic scanner's "Suggested Profile Key" now correctly applies the same protocol-version
  downgrade logic so scan output matches what actual HA detection would choose (previously the
  scanner silently skipped register 30099 when its value was 0 due to a falsy-check bug, and
  returned the V201 profile key before the protocol version block could act on it). **Affected
  users should remove and re-add the integration** to trigger fresh auto-detection.

## v0.7.1

Issues: #249 · #242 · #212

---

### New Profiles

- **SPA series — new profile (#249):** The SPA 3000–6000TL BL (AC-coupled battery storage,
  no PV MPPT inputs) now has a dedicated profile. Previously it auto-detected as
  MIN 7000-10000TL-X and all sensors read zero; with SPH-TL3 manually selected, AC voltage,
  frequency, and load power also read zero because the SPA never populates the 0-124
  register range. The new `spa_3000_6000_tl_bl` profile reads exclusively from the
  1000-1124 range where the SPA keeps all its data. Load power is correctly sourced from
  registers 1037/1038 (SPH-TL3 uses 1021/1022 for this, which are zero on the SPA).
  Confirmed sensors: battery voltage/SOC/temp/type, charge/discharge power, power to grid,
  load power, AC voltage (~216V at reg 1105), and the full energy breakdown set
  (energy to user/grid today/total, battery charge/discharge today/total, load energy
  today/total). Holding register layout (battery management, TOU time periods) is identical
  to SPH-TL3.

### Universal Register Scanner — Device Selector

The Universal Register Scanner service now has a **Device** dropdown at the top of the service
form. Selecting your configured inverter pre-fills all connection details (IP, port, serial path,
baudrate, slave ID) and guarantees that the "CURRENTLY CONFIGURED PROFILE" and "CURRENT ENTITY
VALUES" sections appear in the CSV output. Previously, entity values were only included when the
scanner could match the connection parameters you typed against a running integration entry, which
silently failed for serial connections if the device path differed even slightly. Manual IP/serial
entry fields are still available for scanning a new inverter before it has been added to the
integration.

### Bug Fixes

- **WIT 8K-HU — Battery voltage/current fix (take 2) (#247):** The v0.7.0 multi-candidate
  selection was not actually comparing the VPP register (31214, spurious 5.2V) against the
  native register (8034, correct 53.7V). The candidate loop used
  `_find_register_by_name_with_fallback()` which filters down to a single address based on
  the detected preferred range — so when the VPP range scored non-zero (because 31214 returns
  a wrong-but-non-zero value), only reg 31214 was ever evaluated as a candidate and reg 8034
  was never read. Fixed by replacing the single-address lookup with
  `_find_all_registers_by_name()` so every matching address across all ranges is evaluated.
  The 5.2V value at reg 31214 is then correctly discarded by the 10V plausibility floor and
  the 53.7V from reg 8034 is selected. The same fix is applied to battery current.

### Profile Fixes

- **SPE 8000-12000 ES — register map corrected (#212):** The SPE profile previously inherited
  the SPF register map wholesale. Cross-analysis of the Issue #212 daytime scan against actual
  entity values (from the accompanying XLSX file) revealed several incorrect mappings:
  - Registers 36/37 (`ac_input_power`) produce a 429 GW overflow on SPE — the value is a
    signed 32-bit grid power register that the coordinator interprets as unsigned. These
    registers have been removed from the profile until correct signed semantics are confirmed.
  - Registers 64/65 (SPF: "AC discharge energy today") are **grid import energy today** on SPE.
    Confirmed: 20.0 kWh scan value vs 19.8 kWh actual ✓
  - Registers 66/67 (SPF: "AC discharge energy total") are **grid import energy total** on SPE.
    Confirmed: 855.2 kWh ✓
  - Registers 85/86 (SPF: "operational discharge energy today") are **load energy today** on SPE.
    Confirmed: 21.3 kWh vs 20.9 kWh actual ✓
  - Registers 87/88 (SPF: "operational discharge energy total") are **load energy total** on SPE.
    Confirmed: 1028.3 kWh vs 1027.9 kWh actual ✓
  - Registers 92–97 (generator discharge/power/voltage) removed — SPE has no generator input.
  All confirmed registers (battery voltage 50.12 V, grid voltage 235.8 V, PV1/PV2 voltage/power,
  temperatures, fan speeds, charge/discharge energy totals) remain correctly inherited from SPF.

### Auto-Detection Fixes

- **SPA auto-detection (#249):** SPA responds to all register ranges with zeros rather than
  exceptions, causing it to fall through into the MIN detection branch. Detection now checks
  register 1013 (battery voltage, always ~530 raw = 53 V on SPA) combined with register 38
  (AC voltage in base range, always 0 on SPA). This check runs before the MIN series check.
  SPH-TL3 is not affected — it always has register 38 > 0 (grid voltage present even at
  night). SPH 3-6kW is not affected — its battery voltage is at register 13, not 1013.

- **MIC misclassification of legacy string inverters fixed (#242):** Inverters using the
  legacy 0-124 register range but lacking the 3000+ range were incorrectly detected as MIC
  micro inverters if their PV voltage happened to be non-zero at register 3. MIC micro
  inverters operate at low panel voltages (< 80 V raw). The detection now checks: if reg 3
  raw > 800 (> 80 V) and the 3000+ range is absent, the device is a legacy string inverter,
  not a MIC. It falls back to `min_7000_10000_tl_x` as the closest approximation and logs a
  warning. A dedicated legacy profile for this firmware class (DM1.0, ~11 kW, 3 strings,
  0-124 range only) is planned pending further scan data and model confirmation.

### Fixes

- **SPH TL3 — Energy Today drop at sunset fixed (#225):** Per-MPPT energy registers
  (`pv1/2/3_energy_today`) are now used whenever any string has accumulated energy today,
  regardless of whether PV voltage/power is currently non-zero. Previously the data source
  switched to register 54 (AC output total, which includes battery discharge) at the moment
  PV production stopped, causing a visible drop of ~2 kWh at end of day. The per-MPPT sum
  is now held through the night and cleared at dawn when the inverter resets its registers.

- **WIT 8K-HU — Battery voltage wrong value fixed (#247):** VPP register 31214
  (`battery_voltage_vpp`, mapped to `battery_voltage`) reports a spuriously low value
  (e.g. 5.2 V) on some WIT firmware variants while the native register 8034 carries the
  correct reading (53.7 V). The integration now applies the same multi-candidate
  selection strategy already used for battery current: all available voltage registers are
  read, values outside the plausible range (10–800 V) are discarded, and the highest
  remaining candidate is selected. This resolves the secondary symptom too — battery power
  scale auto-detection was failing because V×I ≈ 1 W never exceeded the 50 W threshold.

- **SPF — Battery Power always zero fixed (#174):** The `_validate_spf_battery_power_sign`
  function referenced `data.inverter_status`, which does not exist as a `GrowattData` field.
  The correct field is `data.status`. The `AttributeError` was silently caught by the battery
  data exception handler, leaving `battery_power` permanently at 0W.

- **SPH Hybrid — Load First Battery Minimum SOC display bugfix (#244):** Corrected reading
  and display of the Load First SOC value introduced in v0.6.8.

### New Sensors & Profile Updates

- **MID Series — Grid, load energy and battery sensors (#240):** The MID profile was missing
  a large block of registers that the hardware responds to. Now available on both legacy and
  V2.01 variants:
  - **Grid power flow:** `power_to_grid`, `power_to_user`, `power_to_load` (regs 3041–3046)
  - **Grid energy counters:** `energy_to_grid_today/total`, `energy_to_user_today/total`
    (regs 3067–3074)
  - **Load energy counters:** `load_energy_today`, `load_energy_total` (regs 3075–3078)
  - `grid_energy_today` now reads directly from register 3071/3072 instead of a calculation
    that collapsed to zero when load energy was unavailable
  - V2.01 profile gains full battery support (31200+ VPP range, confirmed responding):
    voltage (31214, 404.8 V confirmed), SOC (31217), current (31215/31216), temperature
    (31222/31223), SOH (31218), power (31200/31201), charge/discharge energy (31202–31209)
  - `has_battery` is now `True` for `mid_15000_25000tl3_x_v201`

- **SPH / TL-XH — Accurate lifetime PV generation (#243):** Registers 91/92
  (`Epv_total H/L`, Growatt V1.39 protocol) added to SPH and TL-XH profiles. This is the
  raw DC-side cumulative generation shown in ShinePhone as "Total Power Generation" and is
  more reliable for the HA energy dashboard than `energy_total` (regs 55/56), which is a
  net calculated value that can drift with battery cycling. MOD, WIT, and SPH-TL3 already
  had these registers; MIC and SPF use 91/92 for other purposes and are unchanged.

- **SPH — Export Limit Registers Added (#131):** Holding registers 122 (`export_limit_mode`,
  0=Disabled/1=RS485) and 123 (`export_limit_power`, ×0.1 %) were missing from SPH 3-6kW
  and 7-10kW profiles. Now defined in both base profiles and inherited by all V2.01 variants.

- **SPE auto-detection fixed (#212):** DTC code 64541 is now mapped to `spe_8000_12000_es`.
  Previously the integration fell through to SPH 7-10kW on first setup.

### Changes at a Glance

- **MOD GEN4 — TOU reversion root cause fixed:** Register 3049 ("Allow Grid Charge") was
  missing from the integration. On GEN4 hardware this register is a prerequisite gate —
  without it enabled, the firmware silently discards TOU writes after each cloud sync cycle.
  A new **"Allow Grid Charge"** select entity is now exposed under the Battery device.
- **MOD GEN4 — TOU enable/priority atomic write fix (#234):** `GrowattModTouEnable` and
  `GrowattModTouPriority` previously wrote only the start register (single-register FC06
  write). Both selects now write `[start, end]` atomically in one FC16 transaction —
  matching `GrowattModTouTime` and the Solax Modbus Growatt plugin. This should resolve
  enable/priority reversion; if it still occurs the ShineWiFi dongle is the likely cause.
- **MOD GEN4 — Duplicate "Allow Grid Charge" entity fixed (#234):** The entity was being
  registered twice (generic loop + dedicated class), causing HA to silently discard the
  correct battery-device-assigned instance. Fixed with a skip guard in the generic loop.
- **MOD GEN4 — TOU slots 5–9 added:** GEN4 hardware supports 9 time slots
  (registers 3038–3059, gap at 3046–3049 for EMS controls). Slots 5–9 now fully supported.
- **MOD GEN4 — TOU time entities now correct in automations (#234):** `GrowattModTouTime`
  now sets `_attr_has_entity_name = True` (consistent with all other entity classes),
  ensuring TOU Period Start/End time pickers appear correctly under the Battery device in
  HA's automation action picker alongside the Enable and Priority selects.
- **MOD GEN4 — Atomic FC16 writes for TOU time:** Start and end registers written together
  in one Modbus FC16 transaction, eliminating the partial-update window.
- **SPH GEN3 — Extended time periods:** Battery First extended slots 4–6 (registers
  1017–1025) and Grid First extended slots 4–9 (registers 1026–1034 and 1080–1088) now
  exposed as time picker and enable select entities (#131).
- **SPH GEN3 — AC Charge period naming fixed (#131):** The three original time period
  entities (registers 1100–1108) now display as "AC Charge Time Period 1–3" rather than
  the ambiguous "Time Period 1–3", making it clear they are distinct from the Battery First
  and Grid First extended slots. Entity IDs are unchanged.
- **SPH GEN3 — Grid First periods 1–3 intentionally absent (#131):** The SPH GEN3 register
  map does not expose separate Grid First slots 1–3. The AC Charge periods (1100–1108) are
  a separate scheduling feature. If Grid First 4+ values revert immediately, check whether
  the ShineWiFi dongle is connected and overriding local writes.
- **SPH Hybrid — Load First Battery Minimum SOC control (#238):** New slider entity for SPH
  3-6kW and 7-10kW (and their V2.01 variants) setting the minimum SOC the inverter will
  discharge to in Load First mode. Register 608, range 10–100 %, under the Battery device.
- **MOD — Grid Power fallback for zero 3000-range reads (#228):** When registers 3043/3044
  (`power_to_grid`) return 0, the coordinator now falls back to VPP meter registers
  31112/31113 for the correct signed grid power value.
- **WIT — Battery current largest-absolute-value selection (#226):** The previous cascade
  accepted the first non-zero reading from VPP register 31215. Some WIT firmware returns a
  small but incorrect non-zero on 31215 (e.g. −0.1 A when the actual current is +11.3 A).
  The coordinator now reads all available registers (31215, 8035, 3170) and picks the one
  with the largest absolute value within a ±300 A sanity bound.
- **New control guide:** `docs/CONTROLS.md` with per-model instructions, SVG diagrams, and
  automation examples for MOD, SPH, WIT, and SPF.

### ⚠️ Upgrading from v0.6.6 — Entity ID Changes (#231)

> **If you are upgrading from v0.6.6**, all entity IDs changed in v0.6.7. This also affects upgrades from v0.6.6 to v0.6.8.
>
> v0.6.6 introduced sub-devices (Solar, Grid, Load, Battery) but left the integration prefix in entity names, causing HA to generate IDs with a double prefix — for example `sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_growatt_modbus_energy_to_grid_today`.
>
> **v0.6.7 corrected this.** Entity IDs are now short and clean — e.g. `sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_energy_to_grid_today`. The entity registry and statistics history are migrated automatically, but **the Energy Dashboard, automations, Lovelace cards, and any other configuration that references entity IDs by string must be updated manually.**
>
> See the [full migration guide in the v0.6.7 release notes](#v067) below for the complete before/after ID table and details.

### MOD GEN4 — TOU setup guide

For each TOU period you want active:

1. Enable **Allow Grid Charge** (Battery device, one-time prerequisite for GEN4)
2. Set **TOU Period N Start** and **TOU Period N End** (time picker entities)
3. Set **TOU Period N Priority** → `Load Priority`, `Battery Priority`, or `Grid Priority`
4. Set **TOU Period N Enable** → `Enabled`

Slots 1–4 use registers 3038–3045. Slots 5–9 use registers 3050–3059. Registers 3046–3049 are EMS controls — the gap between slot 4 and slot 5 is intentional. If values still revert after enabling Allow Grid Charge, the ShineWiFi dongle cloud sync may be overriding local writes — disable cloud sync in the dongle's web UI or the Growatt app.

### SPH GEN3 — Extended time period guide

Set the global **Priority Mode** (register 1044) to `Battery First` or `Grid First`, then configure individual windows using the time picker and enable entities for each slot group. Grid First slots 1–3 are not exposed separately — the AC Charge Time Period slots (1100–1108) are a distinct feature for scheduling AC charging, not Grid First priority windows.

### 🔧 Fix — MOD: Grid Power Shows 0 or Wrong Direction (#228)

On MOD inverters (e.g. `mod_6000_15000tl3_x`), the 3000-range registers 3043/3044 (`power_to_grid_high/low`) return 0 on some firmware builds even when the inverter is actively importing or exporting. Because `power_to_grid` was 0, the `grid_power` sensor fell through to the fallback calculation `(solar + discharge) − (load + charge)`, which can produce an incorrect or opposite-sign result.

The VPP registers 31112/31113 (`meter_power`) carry the correct signed 32-bit value for the same measurement (positive = export, negative = import). In the confirmed scan: 3044 = 0 while 31113 decoded to **−9,601.8 W** (importing).

**Fix:**

- `profiles/mod.py`: `maps_to='power_to_grid_low'` added to register 31113 so it is found by the fallback lookup.
- `growatt_modbus.py`: When the primary `power_to_grid_low` (3044) reads 0, the coordinator now tries `meter_power_low` (31113 via `_find_register_by_name_with_fallback`) before accepting 0 W. Non-zero VPP value is used and logged at DEBUG.

---

### 🔧 Fix — WIT: Battery Current Shows 0 When VPP Register 31215 Returns 0 (#226)

Some WIT firmware variants do not implement `Ibat` in the VPP cluster register 31215 — it returns 0 permanently while the battery is actively charging or discharging. Because VPP was the preferred range (voltage and SOC via VPP were correct), the coordinator selected 31215, read 0, and never tried the native 8000-range register 8035 (which held the correct signed value, e.g. raw 65477 = −5.9 A charging).

**Fix:**

- `growatt_modbus.py`: Battery current now cascades — VPP (31215) → native 8035 → 3000-range 3170 — before accepting 0 A. A non-zero value at any fallback stage short-circuits the chain and is logged at DEBUG.
- `profiles/wit.py`: Registers 3169/3170/3171 added as internal fallback sources (`battery_voltage_3k`, `battery_current_3k`, `battery_soc_3k`). These are not exposed as HA sensors.

## v0.6.7

Issues: #231 · #226 · #228

> ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE (upgrading from v0.6.6):** All entity IDs changed in this release. The integration migrates them automatically on first load, but automations, scripts, and dashboards that reference entity IDs by string must be updated manually. See the full details in the migration guide section below.

### Changes at a Glance

- **Entity ID regression fixed (#231):** v0.6.6's sub-device change caused entity IDs to grow a double prefix (e.g., `sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_growatt_modbus_energy_to_grid_today`). IDs are now correct and short. **All existing entity IDs are automatically migrated on first load**, but automations/dashboards using the old bugged IDs will need updating.
- **WIT battery current no longer drops to 0 A when the 8000-range block read fails intermittently (#226)** — critical registers are now retried individually after a failed block read.
- **MOD HU (MOD 12-KTL3-HU, MOD TL3-XH) improvements (#228):**
  - `pv1_energy_today`, `pv2_energy_today`, and `pv_energy_total` sensors now work (registers were missing from MOD profile)
  - `charge_stopped_soc`, `discharge_stopped_soc`, `charge_power_rate`, and `ac_charge_enable` controls added to MOD profile
  - Battery power now sourced from VPP range (31200/31201) — more reliable than the intermittent 3000-range charge/discharge registers
  - DTC code 5401 (MOD 12-KTL3-HU) added to auto-detection — fresh installs now select the correct Hybrid profile automatically

---

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE — Entity IDs Changed for All Entities (#231)

**This release changes entity IDs for all sensors, controls, and binary sensors.**

#### Background

v0.6.6 introduced sub-devices (Solar, Grid, Load, Battery) so entities could be logically grouped in the Home Assistant device list. When an entity belongs to a sub-device, HA generates its entity ID by combining the sub-device slug with the entity name slug. This was unintentional at the time: because entity `_attr_name` still included the integration prefix ("Growatt Modbus …"), HA created IDs with a double prefix — for example:

```text
sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_growatt_modbus_energy_to_grid_today
                         ↑ sub-device slug   ↑ entity name slug (still had prefix)
```

#### What the fix does

Entity classes now set `has_entity_name = True` and use only the **short name** (e.g., "Energy to Grid Today"). HA then composes:

```text
{domain}.{device_slug}_{short_name_slug}
sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_energy_to_grid_today
```

#### Automatic migration

The integration migrates all existing entity IDs on first load using the entity registry (`unique_id` is the stable anchor — the entity's internal identity never changes, only its ID string). You will see log entries like:

```text
v0.6.7 entity ID migration: sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_growatt_modbus_energy_to_grid_today → sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_energy_to_grid_today
```

#### What you need to do

The entity registry migration is automatic — the integration's entities will appear under their new IDs immediately, and **long-term statistics history is preserved** (HA keys statistics to the stable `unique_id`, not the entity ID string).

**However, the following do NOT update automatically and must be reconfigured manually:**

- **Energy Dashboard** — HA stores the Energy Dashboard configuration as hardcoded entity ID strings in `.storage/energy`. You must re-open Settings → Energy and re-select each sensor (grid import/export, solar production, battery charge/discharge, etc.) using the new IDs.
- **Automations or scripts** that reference entity IDs by string (not the entity picker)
- **Lovelace dashboard cards** that hardcode entity IDs rather than using the entity picker
- **External integrations or Node-RED flows** using the old IDs

#### New entity ID pattern (examples)


| Entity               | Old ID (v0.6.6 bugged)                                           | New ID (v0.6.7)                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Energy to Grid Today | `sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_growatt_modbus_energy_to_grid_today` | `sensor.growatt_modbus_grid_energy_to_grid_today` |
| Battery SoC          | `sensor.growatt_modbus_battery_growatt_modbus_battery_soc`       | `sensor.growatt_modbus_battery_battery_soc`       |
| PV Energy Today      | `sensor.growatt_modbus_solar_growatt_modbus_energy_today`        | `sensor.growatt_modbus_solar_energy_today`        |
| House Consumption    | `sensor.growatt_modbus_load_growatt_modbus_house_consumption`    | `sensor.growatt_modbus_load_house_consumption`    |
| Inverter Status      | `sensor.growatt_modbus_growatt_modbus_inverter_status`           | `sensor.growatt_modbus_inverter_status`           |

> **Note:** If your integration name is not "Growatt Modbus" (e.g., you renamed it during setup), substitute your actual device name slug in the examples above.

### 🔧 Fix — WIT Battery Current Drops to 0 A on Intermittent Block Read Failure (#226)

WIT inverters read battery registers from the 8000–8999 range in a single block. If that block read fails (intermittent RS485/TCP instability), all 8000-range registers are absent from the cache for that cycle. `battery_current` (register 8035) resolves to `None or 0.0 = 0.0`, so the entity shows 0 A — even when the battery is actively charging or discharging.

**Fix (`growatt_modbus.py`):** After any failed 8000-range block read, the five most critical registers (8034 battery voltage, 8035 battery current, 8093–8095 battery SoC / charge state) are retried individually. If a single-register read succeeds, that value is placed in the cache and used for the cycle. A warning log is emitted on block failure; per-register retry results are logged at DEBUG level.

---

### 🔧 Fix — MOD HU: PV String Energy Sensors Always 0 (#228)

`pv1_energy_today`, `pv2_energy_today`, and `pv_energy_total` were absent from the MOD TL3-XH hybrid profile. The corresponding registers (59/60, 63/64, 91/92) are in the base 0–124 scan range and respond correctly on MOD HU hardware (confirmed: 9.2 kWh, 10.4 kWh, 3445 kWh).

**Fix (`profiles/mod.py`):** Registers 59/60, 63/64, and 91/92 added to `MOD_6000_15000TL3_XH` `input_registers`.

---

### 🔧 Fix — MOD HU: Battery Power Intermittently Shows 0 (#228)

The 3000-range charge/discharge registers (3178–3181) used as the primary battery power source on MOD HU are unreliable — they intermittently return 0 during the same poll cycle in which `battery_power` at VPP registers 31200/31201 shows the correct value (+1130 W charging in scan #228-2).

**Fix (`profiles/mod.py`):** Registers 31200/31201 renamed from `battery_power_vpp_high/low` to `battery_power_high/low`. With the `_vpp` suffix removed, the coordinator's standard fallback chain finds these registers as the primary signed battery power source. Charge/discharge power entities are then derived from the sign of `battery_power` — positive = charging, negative = discharging — consistent with the standard convention used by all other profiles.

---

### New — MOD HU: Charge/Discharge SOC Controls (#228)

The following controls now appear on MOD Hybrid installs. All four holding registers were confirmed responding in scan #228:


| Control               | Register | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Discharge Stopped SoC | 1071     | Minimum SoC before battery stops discharging |
| Charge Power Rate     | 1090     | Battery charge power rate limit (0–100%)    |
| Charge Stopped SoC    | 1091     | SoC level at which battery stops charging    |
| AC Charge Enable      | 1092     | Allow charging from the grid (AC source)     |

---

### New — Auto-Detection: DTC Code 5401 (#228)

DTC code 5401 (reported by MOD 12-KTL3-HU hardware) was not in the detection map. Fresh installs fell back to heuristic detection and selected the grid-tied MOD profile instead of the Hybrid profile.

**Fix (`auto_detection.py`):** DTC 5401 now maps to `mod_6000_15000tl3_xh_v201` (same as DTC 5400).

---

---

### 🔧 Fix — Energy Sensors Show 0 at Night / After HA Restart (Issues #206, re-fix)

Two further root causes found after the v0.6.6b2 fix for issue #206:

1. **Empty register response not treated as failure** (`growatt_modbus.py`): When the RS485-to-TCP adapter is online but the inverter is sleeping, some adapters return a valid TCP frame with an empty register list. This passed the non-None check, set `_inverter_online = True`, and all sensor values defaulted to `0.0`. Empty and short-count responses are now rejected as read failures, correctly triggering offline behaviour.
2. **Energy retention not persisted across HA restarts** (`coordinator.py`): `_retained_lifetime_totals` and `_retained_daily_totals` were in-memory dicts, cleared on every restart. After a nighttime HA restart, there was no retained baseline to compare against when the dormant inverter returned zeros. These dicts are now persisted to HA storage (`.storage/growatt_modbus.<entry_id>_energy_totals`) — lifetime totals always restored; daily totals restored only if saved on the same calendar day.
3. **Wrong field names in debounce reset** (`coordinator.py`): The wakeup debounce was assigning to `data.battery_charge_today` / `data.battery_discharge_today` (non-existent fields). Corrected to `charge_energy_today` / `discharge_energy_today`.
4. **Battery energy fields missing from midnight reset** (`coordinator.py`): Both midnight reset paths now zero `charge_energy_today`, `discharge_energy_today`, `ac_charge_energy_today`, `ac_discharge_energy_today`, `op_discharge_energy_today`.

---

### 🔧 Fix — Energy Totals Dropping to Zero on Dormant/Offline Inverters (Issue #206)

`total_increasing` energy sensors returned `0` when the inverter was dormant at night or truly offline, causing phantom counter resets in the HA Energy Dashboard.

**Two root causes:**

1. **Dormant inverter:** Stays powered (battery/grid) and responds to Modbus but returns `0` for all production registers. Connection succeeds → `_inverter_online = True` → sensors report zeros.
2. **Truly offline inverter:** Coordinator returned cached data with `last_update_success = True` → entities stayed "available" → HA recorded stale flatlines as real data.

**Fix:**

- **`available = False` when offline:** Sensor entities check `coordinator.is_online`. All entities go unavailable when the inverter stops responding — statistics engine ignores unavailable states.
- **Dormant-inverter retention:** `_protect_energy_totals()` tracks last known non-zero values. When hardware reports `0` but a non-zero was previously seen, the retained value is substituted. Daily retention clears at midnight.

---

### 🔧 Fix — WIT Battery Current Always Shows 0 (Issue #226)

WIT's `battery_current` register is at address 8035 (8000–8124 range). Battery range detection only scored VPP (≥31000) and fallback (1000–3999) addresses — 8035 was never scored, range resolved as `'vpp'`, filter `addr >= 31000` excluded register 8035 → `battery_current = 0`.

**Fix** (`growatt_modbus.py`): 8000–8999 addresses now count as VPP-tier in `_detect_battery_register_range()`. `_find_register_by_name_with_fallback()` also checks the 8000-range as a secondary fallback when the primary range filter returns empty. This also restores battery power scale auto-detection which requires `battery_current != 0`.

The 20% power overestimation noted in the same issue is not yet addressed — register scan data needed to confirm root cause.

---

### 🔧 Fix — MIN TL-XH: Startup Warning Spam + via_device Error (Issue #224)

**A) Startup Modbus warnings:** MIN TL-XH receives `ExceptionResponse(exception_code=1)` for optional VPP registers (31000+) that don't exist on its firmware. These were already suppressed after the first attempt via `_failed_optional_ranges`, but the first-attempt log was at WARNING level. A new `log_errors` parameter on `read_input_registers()` downgrades first-attempt errors to DEBUG for optional register ranges.

**B) `via_device` race condition (HA 2025.12+):** Sub-devices reference `via_device = (DOMAIN, f"{entry_id}_inverter")`. The parent device could be missing from the registry when sub-device sensors registered, causing "referencing a non-existing via_device" errors. Fixed by explicitly pre-creating the parent inverter device in `__init__.py` using `device_registry.async_get_or_create()` before `async_forward_entry_setups()`.

---

### 🔧 Fix — Control Authority Selector Shown on Unsupported Hardware (Issue #224)

`control_authority` (register 30100) appeared as a select entity on MIN TL-XH, MIN TL-X, and other profiles where the hardware does not implement the VPP 2.01 control register range. Any write silently failed with Illegal Function.

**Fix:** The entity is now gated on a live hardware probe — same pattern as `vpp_export_limit_enable`. A `vpp_control_authority_available` flag is set only when register 30100 returns a valid response at startup. If unresponsive, the entity is not created and any pre-existing stale entity is removed from the entity registry on reload.

---

### 🔧 Fix — TL-XH / MOD / WIT Serial Number Entity Shows Incorrect Value

The `serial_number` sensor entity on VPP-range models read from holding registers 9–13 (legacy base range), which on VPP firmware does not contain the serial number — producing garbled output (e.g. "AL1.0ZAba").

VPP-range models store the serial number in holding registers 3001–3005 (10 ASCII chars, one pair per register). After the legacy read, affected profiles now attempt a second read of that range. If the result is a valid Growatt-format serial (≥4 chars, first two letters), it overrides; otherwise the legacy value is kept as fallback.

**Models affected:** All profiles with `TL_XH`, `MOD_`, or `WIT_` in the register map name. Note: the HA Devices & Services serial was already correct via the coordinator's separate read path — only the sensor entity was wrong.

---

### 🔧 Fix — WIT: Disabling Control Authority Resets Export Limit Mode (Issue #203)

Disabling `control_authority` (register 30100 = 0) transiently resets register 122 (`export_limit_mode`) to 0 as a WIT hardware side-effect. Older firmware does not auto-restore the value, silently clearing the export limit configuration.

**Fix** (`select.py`, `coordinator.py`): Register 122 is read and saved before writing `control_authority = Disabled`. When `control_authority = Enabled` is written and verified, the saved value is restored after a 300ms delay. WIT profiles only.

---

### ✨ New — SPE 8000-12000 ES Profile (Issue #212)

Added support for the **SPE 8000-12000 ES** single-phase hybrid inverter. Register scan analysis confirmed it uses the same Modbus register protocol as SPF (registers 0–97), despite being grid-tied with peak shaving capability. Features: dual MPPT, battery storage, peak shaving, parallel operation (up to 108kW), dual outputs.

Auto-detection via model name patterns (SPE8000, SPE10000, SPE12000). Manual selection available as "SPE (8-12kW)".

---

### ✨ New — Write Verification & Cloud Override Detection (Issue #214)

All control writes now include **read-back verification** with up to 3 retries. If a verified write is later found to have reverted on the next poll cycle (e.g. overwritten by ShineWiFi dongle), a **persistent notification** appears in HA explaining the issue. A setup warning is also shown when configuring a battery-enabled inverter with a cloud dongle detected.

---

### 🔧 Fix — Stale Time Period `number` Entities After Upgrade (Issue #214)

After upgrading from pre-v0.6.4, old `number` platform `time_period_*_start/end` entities remained alongside the new `time` platform entities. Entity registry migration in `__init__.py` removes the stale entities automatically on HA restart.

---

### 🔧 Fix — VPP Export Limit Controls Appear on Non-VPP Inverters

MIN TL-X and other non-VPP inverters showed `VPP Export Limit Enable` and `VPP Export Limit Power Rate` controls even though the hardware does not support registers 30200–30201.

**Fix:** Entity creation is gated on a `vpp_export_limit_available` flag set only when those registers respond. Stale entities are removed on reload.

---

### ✨ New — MOD TL3-XH TOU Schedule Controls (Issue #131)

MOD Hybrid users can now set Time-of-Use schedule periods from Home Assistant: 4 × time period start (HH:MM), 4 × end, 4 × priority (Load/Battery/Grid), 4 × enable. Uses holding registers 3038–3045 with bit-packed encoding (`bit15=enable, bit13-14=priority, bit8-12=hour, bit0-7=minute`).

---

### 🔧 Fix — SPF Battery Power and Energy Sensors Showing Zero (Issues #204, #18)

Three root causes fixed:

1. **Offline behaviour classification:** `battery_charge_total`, `battery_discharge_total`, `ac_charge_energy_total`, and related sensors were not correctly classified in `SENSOR_TYPES`, causing them to drop to 0 when offline instead of going unavailable.
2. **AC input / load power offline behaviour:** `ac_input_power`, `ac_apparent_power`, and `load_power` were not classified as `power` sensors, causing them to go unavailable when they should hold `0` while offline.
3. **Battery power zeroed at SOC > 0:** The 10V voltage guard (to prevent garbage readings from a disconnected battery) also blocked power readings from connected batteries reporting 0V in bypass/standby. The guard now requires **both** voltage `< 10V` **and** SOC `< 5%` before zeroing battery power.

---

### ✨ New — Universal Scanner: VPP Control Ranges + MOD Holding Ranges

Scanner now covers VPP control holding registers (30100–30499, individually enabled via `scan_vpp_control`) and MOD TL3-XH FC04 holding ranges including TOU registers 3038–3045 (`scan_mod_extended`).

---

## v0.6.4

- #204 · #214

### 🔧 Fix — Time Period Controls Show HH:MM Time Picker Instead of Raw Numbers (Issue #214)

**SPH** inverter users with time period controls (e.g., SPH 3600) reported the start/end time displays showing values like `1.536` and `5.632` instead of readable times. These correspond to 06:00 and 22:00. Any attempted writes were sending incorrect values to the inverter hardware.

**Root cause:** The inverter stores time in a **hex-packed byte format** — `hours × 256 + minutes` — not the HHMM decimal format the code assumed. 06:00 encodes as `0x0600 = 1536` and 22:00 as `0x1600 = 5632`. The previous `NumberEntity` implementation displayed the raw integer directly (showing `1536`) and wrote user-entered values without conversion (writing `600` for "06:00" produced `0x0258` = 02h 88m — invalid time).

**Fix:**

- Replaced the 6 time period start/end `NumberEntity` controls with a new `TimeEntity` platform (`time.py`)
- `TimeEntity` provides a native **HH:MM time picker** in the Home Assistant UI
- Decode: `raw → (hours = raw >> 8, minutes = raw & 0xFF) → datetime.time(hours, minutes)`
- Encode: `datetime.time(h, m) → (h << 8) | m → register write`
- Added `Platform.TIME` to `__init__.py` platform list
- Number entities no longer created for `time_period_*_start/end` controls (to avoid duplicates)

**Impact:** Time period enable controls (`time_period_*_enable`) are unchanged — they remain Select entities (Enabled/Disabled).

---

### 🔧 Fix — SPF 5000/6000 ES Battery Entities Showing Zero Since v0.6.0 (Issue #204)

**SPF 5000 ES** and **SPF 6000 ES Plus** users reported all battery entities (voltage, SOC, power, temperature) showing 0 after upgrading from v0.5.9. Direct register reads confirmed the data was present — e.g., register 18 returned 48.73V — but the HA entity showed 0.0V.

**Root cause:** Commit `e26a870` (v0.6.0) introduced `_detect_battery_register_range()` to resolve an ambiguity in models that expose battery data at both VPP (31000+) and fallback (1000–3999) addresses. The scoring logic awards points only for addresses in those two ranges. SPF uses the legacy base range (registers 0–97), so neither score incremented — both stayed 0 — and the code defaulted to `'fallback'`. The subsequent `_find_register_by_name_with_fallback()` then filtered for `1000 ≤ addr < 4000`, which excluded SPF's register 17 (`battery_voltage`), returning `None`. All battery values silently fell back to 0.

**Fix:** Added `'legacy'` range handling to both methods in `growatt_modbus.py`. When `offgrid_protocol=True` (set in all SPF profiles), `_detect_battery_register_range()` immediately returns `'legacy'` without running the scoring loop. `_find_register_by_name_with_fallback()` then accepts any address below 1000 for `'legacy'` range — matching SPF's register space correctly.

## v0.6.3

- #174 · #207 · #209 · #210 · #211

### 🔧 Fix — SPH TL3 Energy Today Missing PV3 String (Issue #211)

**SPH TL3 10000** (and other 3-MPPT models) showed `Energy Today` roughly **1/3 lower than expected** after the v0.5.0 upgrade.

**Root cause:** The v0.5.0 fix for Issue #172 changed `energy_today` to use per-MPPT DC energy registers (pv1+pv2) instead of AC output register 53-54. However, the profile and coordinator never included **PV string 3** (registers 67-68, `Epv3_today`) in the sum — so on 3-string inverters the PV3 contribution was silently dropped.

**Fix:**

- Added `pv3_energy_today_high/low` (registers 67-68) to `profiles/sph_tl3.py`
- Added `pv3_energy_today` field to `GrowattData` dataclass
- Coordinator now reads PV3 energy and includes it in the `energy_today` sum when PV3 is connected

**Impact:** 2-string models are unaffected (`pv3_connected = False` gates the addition).

---

### 🔧 Fix — SPH TL3 Grid Import Energy Mirrors Export (Issues #209, #211)

**SPH TL3** users with `Invert Grid Power` enabled reported that `Grid Import Energy Today` showed the same values as grid export energy — effectively mirroring it.

**Root cause:** The v0.5.1 fix for Issue #183 introduced a code path where, when `invert_grid_power=True` and a hardware energy register is available, the code reads from `energy_to_grid_today` (export) instead of `energy_to_user_today` (import). This was based on the assumption that CT clamp orientation also swaps the hardware energy accumulators.

**Why the assumption is wrong:** SPH TL3's energy registers (1044-1051) are accumulated by the inverter's **internal bidirectional power meter**, independent of CT clamp direction. `energy_to_user_today` always correctly measures grid import regardless of CT orientation — only real-time power registers need CT inversion.

**Fix:** Removed the CT-orientation swap for hardware energy registers in `sensor.py`. When hardware import registers are available, they are always used directly. The `invert_grid_power` flag continues to apply correctly to all real-time power sensors.

---

### 🔧 Fix — SPH 3-6kW and 7-10kW V2.01 Missing Power Flow Registers (Issue #207)

**SPH 3600** (and all SPH 3-10kW V2.01 protocol models) showed **incorrect grid import/export direction** and **Power to User / Power to Load always 0**.

**Root cause:** The `SPH_3000_6000_V201` and `SPH_7000_10000_V201` profiles were missing the storage-range power flow registers (1015-1038) and grid import energy registers (1044-1047). Without them, `power_to_user`, `power_to_grid`, and `power_to_load` stayed at 0, causing the fallback calculation `(solar + discharge) − (load + charge)` to produce wrong grid direction signs.

**Fix:** Added the following registers to both V201 profiles in `profiles/sph.py`, per Growatt Modbus RTU V1.20 protocol:


| Register  | Name                   | Description                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1021-1022 | `power_to_user`        | AC power to user total (grid import power)       |
| 1029-1030 | `power_to_grid`        | AC power to grid total (signed: positive=export) |
| 1037-1038 | `power_to_load`        | INV power to local load total                    |
| 1044-1045 | `energy_to_user_today` | Grid import energy today                         |
| 1046-1047 | `energy_to_user_total` | Grid import energy total                         |

### 🔧 Fix — SPF Battery Power Sign Correction During PV Charging (Issue #174)

**SPF 6000 ES Plus** intermittently showed battery as **discharging when it was actually charging** from solar (status=5, PV Charge).

**Root cause:** SPF hardware occasionally transmits a positive raw value for the battery power register during PV charging. After applying the required sign inversion (`combined_scale=-0.1`), the result becomes negative — misidentified as discharging. Battery current (register 68) cannot be used for validation as it only measures during AC charging.

**Fix:** Added `_validate_spf_battery_power_sign()` method in `growatt_modbus.py`. When `offgrid_protocol=True`, the inverter status code is checked after the hardware sign inversion. If the status indicates charging (codes 5-10) but battery power is negative, or discharging (code 2) but power is positive, the sign is corrected and a warning is logged. A 10W threshold prevents noise correction. Ambiguous status 12 (PV Charge+Discharge) is skipped.

### 🔧 Fix — SPH TL3 Missing Controls: AC Charge, Time Periods, Priority Mode (Issue #210)

**SPH 10000TL3 BH-UP** (and all SPH TL3 3-10kW models) were missing the **AC Charge**, **Time Period**, and **Discharge/Charge Rate** control entities in Home Assistant. Additionally, **Priority Mode** changes silently failed to write.

**Root cause — two bugs in `profiles/sph_tl3.py`:**

1. **Missing holding registers:** The base profile only defined 3 holding registers (`on_off`, `system_enable`, `priority`). The integration creates control entities only for registers present in the profile, so 14 registers (1070–1071, 1090–1092, 1100–1108) were absent → no entities created.
2. **Wrong register name:** Register 1044 was named `priority` instead of `priority_mode`. All control write paths resolve registers by name — `SELECT_DEFINITIONS` uses the key `priority_mode`, so no holding register was found at write time → silently dropped.

**Fix:** Replaced the `holding_registers` block in `profiles/sph_tl3.py` with the full 18-register set (matching SPH 7-10kW single-phase), adding the correct name and full metadata for each register. The `SPH_TL3_3000_10000_V201` profile inherits these automatically via Python dict unpacking.

**Controls now available for SPH TL3:**


| Register   | Entity               | Description                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1044       | Priority Mode        | Load First / Battery First / Grid First   |
| 1070       | Discharge Power Rate | % limit on battery discharge              |
| 1071       | Discharge Stop SOC   | SOC% at which discharge halts             |
| 1090       | Charge Power Rate    | % limit on battery charge                 |
| 1091       | Charge Stop SOC      | SOC% at which charge halts                |
| 1092       | AC Charge Enable     | Enable/disable charging from grid         |
| 1100–1108 | Time Periods 1–3    | Start/end/enable for timed charge windows |

## v0.6.2

### 🔧 Fix — MIN TL-XH Battery Energy Totals Showing Zero (Issue #191)

Three battery energy sensors were always reporting 0 for **MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 V2.01** inverters after the v0.6.1 upgrade.

**Sensors affected:** Battery Charge Total, Battery Discharge Total, AC Charge Energy Total

**Root cause:** The `MIN_TL_XH_3000_10000_V201` profile defined battery energy *today* registers (3125–3130) but was missing the corresponding *total* registers. The coordinator searched for register names `charge_energy_total_low`, `discharge_energy_total_low`, and `ac_charge_energy_total_low` — none existed in the profile — and fell back to the `GrowattData` defaults of `0.0`. Because `hasattr()` still returned `True` (the field exists in the dataclass), sensors appeared in HA but perpetually showed 0.

**Fix:** Added the missing registers to `profiles/tl_xh.py`, confirmed against real hardware scan:


| Registers   | Sensor                  | Confirmed Value                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 3127 / 3128 | Battery Discharge Total | 481.5 kWh                         |
| 3131 / 3132 | Battery Charge Total    | 528.9 kWh                         |
| 3133 / 3134 | AC Charge Energy Today  | ~0 kWh (grid→battery today)      |
| 3135 / 3136 | AC Charge Energy Total  | 37.4 kWh (grid→battery lifetime) |

The `ac_charge_energy_total` register (3135/3136) tracks exclusively grid→battery charging, matching the Growatt server "Batterieladung aus Stromnetz" lifetime value.

### 🔧 Fix — Energy Sensors Show Unavailable When Inverter is Offline (Issue #206)

Energy sensors (device class `energy`, state class `total_increasing`) previously retained their last value when the inverter went offline at night. When the inverter came back online in the morning, Home Assistant's energy statistics briefly saw the previous day's retained value followed by the new day's value, creating artificial spikes or outliers in the energy dashboard.

**Fix:** Energy sensors now report `unavailable` instead of retaining stale values when the inverter is offline. Home Assistant correctly handles unavailable periods in energy statistics — no data gap is recorded, and the dashboard picks up cleanly from the next valid reading.

**Affected sensors:** All energy sensors (energy today, energy total, grid import/export energy, battery charge/discharge energy, AC charge energy) across all inverter models.

**Before:** Inverter goes offline at 22:00 → sensors retain e.g. 12.5 kWh all night → inverter wakes at 06:00 showing 0.1 kWh → HA records a large negative spike to correct the total.

**After:** Inverter goes offline at 22:00 → sensors show `unavailable` → inverter wakes at 06:00 showing 0.1 kWh → HA records normally with no outlier.

### 🔧 Fix — Battery Power Garbage Values When Battery Disconnected (Issue #205)

On SPF off-grid inverters with a disconnected or fully depleted battery (voltage = 0V), the battery power registers contained garbage values that were being interpreted as valid signed 32-bit readings. This caused the battery power sensor to show absurd values (e.g. **101 MW**) instead of 0W.

**Root cause:** With battery voltage at 0V, register 77 (battery_power_high) = 50000, register 78 (battery_power_low) = 0. Combined as signed 32-bit: −1,018,167,296. Scaled by −0.1: +101,816,729.6 W.

**Fix:** Added a voltage threshold check — if battery voltage is below 10V, battery power is forced to 0W regardless of register values. Affected models: SPF series and potentially other models with battery storage when the battery is physically absent.

### 🆕 MOD TL3-XH — Battery Sensors Added (Issue #131)

The **MOD 10000TL3-XH** (VPP V2.01, DTC 5400) profile now exposes complete battery monitoring from the 3125–3185 and 31218 register ranges. Previously these registers were either absent from the profile or incorrectly mapped (`ac_charge_energy_total` was misidentified as `battery_bms_temp` at register 3136, which would have shown 530.5°C).

**New sensors for MOD TL3-XH:**


| Registers   | Sensor                  | Scale     | Confirmed at Scan       |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 3125 / 3126 | Battery Discharge Today | ×0.1 kWh | 6.3 kWh                 |
| 3127 / 3128 | Battery Discharge Total | ×0.1 kWh | 1216.9 kWh              |
| 3129 / 3130 | Battery Charge Today    | ×0.1 kWh | 4.3 kWh                 |
| 3131 / 3132 | Battery Charge Total    | ×0.1 kWh | 1389.0 kWh              |
| 3133 / 3134 | AC Charge Energy Today  | ×0.1 kWh | 4.0 kWh                 |
| 3135 / 3136 | AC Charge Energy Total  | ×0.1 kWh | 530.5 kWh               |
| 3169        | Battery Voltage         | ×0.01 V  | 72.83 V                 |
| 3170        | Battery Current         | ×0.1 A   | 0.0 A                   |
| 3171        | Battery SOC             | ×1 %     | 10% (confirmed at scan) |
| 3175 / 3176 | Battery Temp            | ×0.1 °C | 45.4°C                 |
| 3178 / 3179 | Battery Discharge Power | ×0.1 W   | 5.0 W                   |
| 3180 / 3181 | Battery Charge Power    | ×0.1 W   | 0.0 W                   |
| 31218       | Battery SOH             | ×1 %     | 100%                    |

Register scan was conducted at night (SOC=10% confirmed), validating register 3171=10 as SOC and 31218=100 as State of Health.

**Bug fix (same PR):** Register 3136 was previously mapped as `battery_bms_temp` — a copy-paste error from a nearby temperature register. The raw value of 5305 × 0.1 = 530.5 kWh is clearly an energy value, not a temperature. Corrected to `ac_charge_energy_total_low`.

**Battery control (MOD):** Battery control holding registers have not yet been confirmed for MOD hardware. Register scan showed the SPH-style 1000–1124 range returns all zeros, and VPP control (30099=0) is not available. Control is deferred to a follow-up release pending hardware confirmation. See [docs/CONTROL.md](docs/CONTROL.md) for details.

## v0.6.1

## 🔧 Critical Fix - MIN TL-XH Solar and Grid-Import Energy Calculations

This release fixes critical energy calculation issues for **MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 V2.01** inverters that were introduced in v0.5.1.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem 1: Grid Import Energy Showing Zero or Null**

After upgrading from v0.4.9 to v0.5.1+, MIN TL-XH users reported:

- Grid import energy became null/zero after update
- Grid power visible but grid import energy was 0
- Energy dashboard showed no grid import despite actually importing from grid

**Root Cause:**
Version 0.5.1 (commit df333cb) fixed SPH-TL3 grid import energy by using hardware register `energy_to_user_today/total`. However, the code incorrectly assumed this register means "grid import" for ALL inverter models.

The `energy_to_user` register has **different meanings** on different inverter series:

- **SPH family**: `energy_to_user` = Grid IMPORT energy (energy FROM grid TO load)
- **MIN TL-XH family**: `energy_to_user` = Forward active energy (NOT grid import)

This caused MIN TL-XH to use the wrong register (3067-3068) for grid import, resulting in null/zero values.

**Problem 2: Battery Discharge Counted as Solar Production**

MIN TL-XH users reported:

- Solar energy showing higher values than expected
- Battery discharge energy being counted as solar production
- Home energy calculations incorrect due to inflated solar values

**Root Cause:**
The `energy_today` register (3049-3050) on MIN TL-XH represents total system AC output and includes battery discharge. When battery was discharging, this energy was incorrectly counted as solar production.

### The Fix:

**1. Restrict `energy_to_user` Hardware Register to SPH Family Only**

Modified grid import energy calculation to only treat `energy_to_user` as grid import for SPH family profiles:

```python
is_sph_family = inverter_series.startswith("sph_")
has_hardware_import = hasattr(data, "energy_from_grid_today") or (
    is_sph_family and hasattr(data, "energy_to_user_today")
)
```

This ensures MIN TL-XH no longer uses the wrong register for grid import calculations.

**2. Derive MIN TL-XH Solar Energy from Energy Balance**

For MIN TL-XH inverters, calculate true PV-only energy from energy balance terms:

```python
pv_energy_today = load_energy + battery_charge + grid_export
                  - grid_import - battery_discharge
```

This ensures:

- Battery discharge is NOT counted as solar production
- Solar energy reflects actual PV generation only
- Energy balance is mathematically correct

### Impact:

**Grid Import Energy:**

- ✅ MIN TL-XH now correctly calculates grid import energy
- ✅ No longer uses wrong `energy_to_user` register
- ✅ Grid import values are accurate and stable
- ✅ SPH family continues to work correctly with `energy_to_user` register

**Solar Energy Production:**

- ✅ Battery discharge no longer counted as solar
- ✅ Solar energy shows accurate PV-only generation
- ✅ Home energy calculations now correct
- ✅ Energy balance mathematically accurate

### Affected Versions:

- **Broken**: v0.5.1 through v0.6.0 (grid import null/zero, battery counted as solar)
- **Working**: v0.4.9 and earlier (used calculated import, but had battery discharge issue)
- **Fixed**: v0.6.1 (both issues resolved)

### Affected Models:

- MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 V2.01 (all models in this series)

### Migration Notes:

- **No action required** - Updates apply automatically on restart
- Grid import energy will immediately show correct values
- Solar energy will decrease to accurate PV-only values (excluding battery discharge)
- Historical data remains unchanged (new calculations start from restart)

### Technical Details:

**Files Changed:**

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/sensor.py`:
  - Restricted `energy_to_user` to SPH family only (lines 1227, 1258)
  - Added MIN TL-XH energy balance calculation (lines 1295-1308)

**Related Issues:**

- Fixes user report: Grid import null after v0.4.9 update
- Fixes user report: Battery discharge counted as solar energy
- Related to Issue #183 (SPH-TL3 grid energy fix that caused this regression)

- Added proper register range detection (VPP vs fallback) to ensure consistent battery data
- Improved fallback register detection with score-based approach

### Impact:

- ✅ SPH, SPM, and MIN TL-XH inverters now show correct battery power signs
- ✅ Battery calculations (V×I) now match power register readings
- ✅ Consistent battery data from detected register range

# Release Notes - v0.5.8

## 🔧 Fix - Battery Power Sign Interpretation for VPP Protocol Registers

This release fixes battery power inversion issues where battery charge/discharge power values were showing with incorrect signs (positive when should be negative, or vice versa) on inverters using VPP Protocol V2.01 registers.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:**
Users with SPH, SPM, and MIN TL-XH inverters using VPP protocol registers reported battery power values showing with inverted signs:

- Battery power showing large positive values (e.g., 56353W) when actually discharging at -918.3W
- Charge/discharge direction appearing backwards in Home Assistant
- Battery power calculations not matching voltage × current

**Root Cause:**
Battery power registers in VPP protocol (31200-31209) use **signed 16-bit values**, but were being interpreted as unsigned integers. This caused:

- Negative discharge values to wrap around to large positive numbers
- Sign bit (0x8000) not being recognized
- Example: -9183 (0xDC31) read as 56353 instead

**Technical Details:**
The existing `_get_register_value()` method already had correct signed conversion logic (lines 664-668 for 32-bit, 682-686 for 16-bit), but only when the register definition includes `'signed': True`. VPP battery power registers were missing this attribute.

### The Fix:

**Added `'signed': True` to VPP battery power registers:**

1. **SPH profiles** (register 31203):

   - `battery_charge_power_low` now marked as signed
2. **TL_XH profiles** (registers 31205, 31209):

   - `charge_power_low` now marked as signed
   - `discharge_power_low` now marked as signed
3. **MIN TL-XH profiles** (registers 31205, 31209):

   - `charge_power_low` now marked as signed
   - `discharge_power_low` now marked as signed

**Updated register descriptions:**

```python
# Before:
31205: {'name': 'charge_power_low', 'desc': 'Battery charge power (unsigned, positive=charging)'}

# After:
31205: {'name': 'charge_power_low', 'signed': True, 'desc': 'Battery charge power (signed: positive=charging, negative=discharging)'}
```

### VPP vs Fallback Register Range Detection

Additionally, this release includes improved battery register fallback detection to ensure consistent data across all battery sensors.

**The Challenge:**
Inverters may support multiple register ranges for battery data:

- **VPP registers** (31200-31299): Modern VPP Protocol V2.01 with signed values
- **Fallback registers** (3000-3999): Legacy range with unsigned/different conventions

Previous implementation would try both ranges independently for each sensor, which could:

- Mix VPP and fallback values across different sensors
- Not distinguish between "legitimately zero" vs "wrong register range"
- Cause inconsistent battery power calculations

**The Solution:**

- Detect which register range is active (VPP vs fallback) **once per session**
- Check multiple key battery sensors (voltage, SOC, power, energy) for non-zero values
- Use score-based detection: whichever range has more non-zero values wins
- Use the detected range **consistently** for ALL battery sensors
- Default to fallback if both ranges are zero (more universal)

This ensures:

- Proper sign interpretation based on register range (VPP=signed, fallback=may vary)
- Consistent data source across all battery sensors
- No mixing of VPP and fallback register data
- Correct handling of legitimate zero values

### Impact:

- ✅ **SPH inverters**: Battery power now shows correct sign (VPP registers properly signed)
- ✅ **MIN TL-XH inverters**: Battery power direction correct (VPP registers properly signed)
- ✅ **All VPP-enabled profiles**: Consistent battery data from detected register range
- ✅ **Fallback registers**: Still work correctly when VPP registers unavailable
- ✅ **Battery calculations**: V×I now matches power register readings

### Affected Models:

**Fixed by VPP register signing:**

- SPH 3-6kW, 7-10kW (VPP Protocol V2.01)
- SPM series
- MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 (VPP Protocol V2.01)
- MOD TL3-XH series

**Improved by register range detection:**

- All models with both VPP and fallback battery registers

### Code Changes:

**Profiles** (`sph.py`, `tl_xh.py`):

- Added `'signed': True` to battery power registers 31203, 31205, 31209
- Updated register descriptions to clarify sign conventions

**Core Logic** (`growatt_modbus.py`):

- Added `_battery_register_range` detection logic
- Score-based detection across multiple battery sensors
- Consistent range usage via `_get_register_value_with_fallback()`

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/sph.py`: Signed battery power registers
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/tl_xh.py`: Signed battery power registers
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/growatt_modbus.py`: VPP vs fallback range detection

## 🔧 Fix - WIT Sensors No Longer Appear on Non-WIT Profiles

This release fixes a sensor visibility issue where **WIT-specific sensors** (`battery_soh` and `battery_voltage_bms`) incorrectly appeared on non-WIT inverter profiles, showing confusing 0 values.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:**
Users with non-WIT inverters (MIN TL-XH, SPH, MOD, etc.) reported seeing WIT-only battery sensors that always showed 0:

- Battery State of Health (SOH): 0%
- Battery Voltage BMS: 0V

These sensors are only valid for **WIT series inverters** (WIT 4-15kW), which have specialized battery management registers.

**Root Cause:**
The `battery_soh` and `battery_voltage_bms` attributes were defined in the `GrowattData` dataclass with default values of 0.0. This meant `hasattr(data, 'battery_soh')` always returned `True`, causing Home Assistant to create sensors for all inverter profiles regardless of whether they actually support these registers.

**Evidence:**

- MIN TL-XH profile: No registers 8094 (battery_soh) or 8095 (battery_voltage_bms)
- SPH TL3 profile: No WIT battery registers
- WIT profile: Has registers 8094 and 8095 ✅

### The Fix:

**Changed sensor creation logic:**

1. **Removed from dataclass defaults**: `battery_soh` and `battery_voltage_bms` no longer have default 0.0 values in `GrowattData`
2. **Set dynamically only**: These attributes are now only created via `setattr()` when:

   - The profile has the corresponding registers (8094, 8095)
   - The registers have valid data
3. **Matches BMS sensor pattern**: This follows the same approach used for other advanced sensors like `bms_soh`, `bms_constant_volt`, etc.

### Impact:

- ✅ **WIT inverters** (WIT 4-15kW): Sensors still created normally (registers exist)
- ✅ **MIN TL-XH inverters**: WIT sensors no longer appear (eliminated confusion)
- ✅ **SPH, MOD, TL-XH**: No WIT sensors (cleaner sensor list)
- ✅ **No user confusion**: Only see sensors your inverter actually supports

### Code Changes:

**Lines 216-217** (`growatt_modbus.py`):

```python
# Before:
battery_soh: float = 0.0          # % (State of Health - WIT)
battery_voltage_bms: float = 0.0  # V (BMS voltage reading - WIT)

# After:
# battery_soh and battery_voltage_bms are WIT-only - set dynamically if register exists
```

**Lines 1724-1737** (`growatt_modbus.py`):

```python
# Changed from direct assignment to conditional setattr:
if addr:
    value = self._get_register_value(addr)
    if value is not None:
        setattr(data, 'battery_soh', value)  # Only set if register exists
```

### Affected Models:

**Benefit from this fix** (cleaner sensor list):

- MIN TL-XH 3000-10000
- SPH 3-6kW, 7-10kW, SPH-TL3
- MOD 6000-15000TL3-XH
- MIC, MIN, MID, TL-XH series
- SPF off-grid series

**Still see these sensors** (as intended):

- WIT 4000-15000TL3 (only series with these registers)

### Migration Notes:

- **No action required** - Updates apply automatically on restart
- WIT sensors will disappear from non-WIT inverters
- No impact on actual functionality, only sensor visibility
- Historical data unaffected

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/growatt_modbus.py`: Updated GrowattData dataclass and battery data reading logic
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/manifest.json`: Version bumped to 0.5.8
- `README.md`: Version badge updated to 0.5.8

# Release Notes - v0.5.7

## 🔧 Critical Fix - MIN TL-XH Battery Registers Corrected (Issue #191)

This release fixes a critical battery sensor issue for **MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 V2.01** inverters where all battery sensors (voltage, current, SOC, temperature) showed zero or incorrect values.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:**
MIN TL-XH users with battery storage (e.g., MIN-4600TL-XH with ARK battery) reported zero values for all battery sensors:

- Battery voltage: 0V (should be ~212V)
- Battery current: 0A
- Battery SOC: 0% (should be actual percentage like 54%)
- Battery temperature: 0°C (should be actual temp like 21.2°C)

**Root Cause:**
The MIN TL-XH V2.01 profile was using VPP Protocol registers (31200+ range) for battery state, based on the official Growatt VPP Protocol V2.01 specification. However, user scan data proved that MIN TL-XH inverters **do NOT use the VPP 31200+ range** for battery state - they use the **3000+ range** (similar to MOD series layout).

**Evidence from user register scan:**

- VPP range (31200-31222): **ALL ZEROS** ❌

  - 31214 battery_voltage: 0
  - 31215 battery_current: 0
  - 31217 battery_soc: 0
  - 31222 battery_temp: 0
- 3000+ range: **HAS BATTERY DATA** ✅

  - 3169: 21194 → 211.94V (scale 0.01)
  - 3170: battery current (scale 0.1)
  - 3171: 54 → 54% SOC
  - 3176: 212 → 21.2°C battery temp (scale 0.1)

### The Fix:

**For MIN_TL_XH_3000_10000_V201 profile:**

1. **Added PRIMARY battery state registers** at 3169-3176 (3000+ range):

   - 3169: battery_voltage (scale 0.01, note different scale than VPP!)
   - 3170: battery_current (scale 0.1, signed)
   - 3171: battery_soc (scale 1)
   - 3176: battery_temp (scale 0.1, signed)
2. **Renamed VPP 31200+ battery registers** with `_vpp` suffix:

   - 31214: battery_voltage_vpp (not used on MIN TL-XH)
   - 31215: battery_current_vpp (not used on MIN TL-XH)
   - 31217: battery_soc_vpp (not used on MIN TL-XH)
   - 31222: battery_temp_vpp (not used on MIN TL-XH)
3. **Important scale difference**: Battery voltage uses scale **0.01** in 3000+ range vs **0.1** in VPP range!

### Impact:

- ✅ **MIN TL-XH with battery**: All battery sensors now show correct values
- ✅ Battery voltage shows actual voltage (e.g., 211.94V instead of 0V)
- ✅ Battery SOC shows actual percentage (e.g., 54% instead of 0%)
- ✅ Battery temperature shows actual temp (e.g., 21.2°C instead of 0°C)
- ✅ MIN TL-XH now uses MOD-like register layout for battery state

### Affected Models:

- MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 V2.01 with battery storage (e.g., MIN-4600TL-XH with ARK battery)

### Technical Background:

The VPP registers were originally added in November 2025 based on the **official Growatt VPP Communication Protocol V2.01 specification** (dated 2024.9.20), which documented the 31200+ range for battery information. The protocol specification was assumed to apply to all V2.01 inverters including MIN TL-XH.

However, user feedback proved this assumption was **incorrect for MIN TL-XH** - these inverters follow the MOD series register layout (3000+ range) for battery state, not the VPP protocol layout. This is a case where real-world hardware behavior differs from the protocol specification.

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/tl_xh.py`:
  - MIN_TL_XH_3000_10000_V201: Added registers 3169-3176 as primary battery state
  - Renamed VPP registers 31214/31215/31217/31222 with _vpp suffix
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/manifest.json`: Version bumped to 0.5.7
- `README.md`: Version badge updated to 0.5.7

### Migration Notes:

- **No action required** - Updates apply automatically on restart
- Battery sensors will immediately show correct values
- If you previously had 0V/0%/0°C, values will now reflect actual battery state
- Historical data remains unchanged (new readings start from restart)

### Related Issues:

- Fixes #191 - MIN TL-XH battery sensors showing zero
- User-confirmed: 3000+ range contains correct battery data, VPP range returns zeros

# Release Notes - v0.5.6

## 🔧 Critical Fix - SPH Battery SOC Register Priority (Issue #185)

This release fixes a critical battery SOC (State of Charge) reading issue for **SPH 3-6kW and 7-10kW V2.01** inverters where the SOC sensor disappeared or showed 0% after upgrading to v0.5.4+.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:**
After upgrading to v0.5.4+, some SPH users reported that battery SOC disappeared or showed 0% instead of the actual value:

- Battery SOC sensor showing 0% despite battery being charged (e.g., should be 100%)
- Register 17 (legacy) returns incorrect value (0%)
- Register 31217 (VPP range) contains the correct SOC value
- The integration was reading register 17 first due to register lookup priority

**Root Cause:**
The `_find_register_by_name('battery_soc')` function searches input registers in insertion order and returns the first name match. Even though register 1086 was added in v0.5.5 as an "override" for standard SPH V201 models:

1. Register 17 (inherited from base profile) with name='battery_soc' was found **first**
2. Register 1086 with name='battery_soc' was never reached
3. Register 31217 with maps_to='battery_soc' was never reached
4. Result: Integration read register 17 (shows 0%) instead of register 31217 (correct value)

### The Fix:

**For SPH 3-6kW and 7-10kW V2.01 profiles:**

1. **Renamed register 17** to `battery_soc_legacy` (prevents name match)
2. **Removed register 1086** (BMS SOC) from standard SPH V201 profiles
   - Register 1086 is only valid for HU models with Battery Management System
   - Standard SPH 3-6kW/7-10kW models don't have BMS, so register 1086 may not respond
3. **Uses register 31217** (VPP range) as primary SOC source via `maps_to='battery_soc'`
   - User-confirmed working in Issue #185
   - Matches VPP Protocol V2.01 specification

### Impact:

- ✅ **SPH 3-6kW V2.01**: Battery SOC now reads from register 31217 (correct value)
- ✅ **SPH 7-10kW V2.01**: Battery SOC now reads from register 31217 (correct value)
- ✅ Register priority fixed: 31217 (VPP) instead of 17 (legacy 0%)
- ✅ HU models unaffected (still use register 1086 BMS SOC)

### Affected Models:

- SPH 3000-6000 V2.01 (standard, non-HU)
- SPH 7000-10000 V2.01 (standard, non-HU)

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/sph.py`:
  - SPH_3000_6000_V201: Renamed register 17, removed register 1086
  - SPH_7000_10000_V201: Renamed register 17, removed register 1086
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/manifest.json`: Version bumped to 0.5.6
- `README.md`: Version badge updated to 0.5.6

### Migration Notes:

- **No action required** - Updates apply automatically on restart
- Battery SOC sensor will immediately show correct percentage
- If you previously had 0% SOC, it will now show actual battery charge level
- Historical data remains unchanged (new readings start from restart)

### Related Issues:

- Fixes #185 - SPH3-6k battery SOC showing 0% after upgrade
- User-confirmed: Register 31217 contains correct SOC value

# Release Notes - v0.5.5

## 🔧 Bug Fix - SPH 7-10kW Battery Sensor Fixes

This release applies the same battery sensor fixes from v0.5.1 (SPH 3-6kW) to the **SPH 7-10kW V2.01** profile, ensuring consistent and accurate battery monitoring across all SPH models.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** SPH 7-10kW V2.01 users were experiencing the same battery sensor issues that were fixed for SPH 3-6kW in v0.5.1, but the fixes were never applied to the 7-10kW profile:

- Battery SOC showing 0% instead of actual value (e.g., should be 85%)
- Battery energy registers showing incorrect values
- AC charge energy sensor potentially showing garbage values

**Root Cause:**
The battery sensor fixes from v0.5.1 (commit 9c71de7) were only applied to SPH_3000_6000_V201 but not to SPH_7000_10000_V201, leaving 7-10kW users with the same issues.

### The Fix:

Applied all three fixes to **SPH_7000_10000_V201** profile:

**1. Battery SOC Fix:**

- Added register 1086 for battery_soc (BMS value)
- Overrides inherited register 17 which shows 0
- Provides correct SOC reading from battery management system

**2. Battery Energy Registers Fix:**

- Changed registers 31202-31203 from `battery_charge_power` to `battery_discharge_today` (energy)
- Added registers 31204-31205 for `battery_charge_total` (kWh)
- Added registers 31206-31207 for `battery_charge_today` (kWh)
- Added registers 31208-31209 for `battery_discharge_total` (kWh)
- Matches VPP Protocol V2.01 specification and real-world register data

**3. AC Charge Energy Fix:**

- Added register 115 for `ac_charge_energy_total`
- Prevents incorrect 32-bit pairing of registers 31220-31221
- Avoids garbage values like 70M+ kWh

### Impact:

- ✅ **SPH 7-10kW** battery SOC now shows correct percentage (was 0%)
- ✅ Battery energy tracking now accurate (charge/discharge today & total)
- ✅ AC charge energy sensor shows correct values
- ✅ **Full parity** with SPH 3-6kW fixes from v0.5.1

### Affected Models:

- SPH 7000-10000 V2.01 (single-phase hybrid with VPP protocol)

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/sph.py`:
  - Line ~579: Added register 1086 (battery_soc from BMS)
  - Lines ~667-675: Fixed battery energy registers 31202-31209
  - Line ~686: Added register 115 (ac_charge_energy_total)

### Migration Notes:

- **No action required** - Updates apply automatically on restart
- Battery sensors will show correct values immediately
- Historical data remains unchanged (new readings start from restart)

# Release Notes - v0.5.4

## 🔧 Bug Fix & Enhancement - Register Scan Improvements (Issue #184)

This release improves the diagnostic register scan service to provide better visibility and reduce confusion when troubleshooting profile selection issues.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** Users manually selecting a profile (e.g., "MIN TL-XH") would run the register scan service and see only the auto-detected profile (e.g., "MOD series") in the CSV output. This caused confusion because:

- The CSV only showed "Suggested Profile Key: mod_6000_15000tl3_xh" (auto-detected)
- It didn't show what profile the user had actually selected and was using
- Users thought the suggested profile was what they had configured

**Impact:**

- User's system was actually working correctly with the selected profile
- But they couldn't see this in the diagnostic output
- Led to confusion and unnecessary troubleshooting

### What's New:

#### 1. Currently Configured Profile Display

The register scan CSV now shows **both** the selected profile AND the auto-detected profile:

```csv
SCAN METADATA
Connection Type,TCP
Slave ID,1

CURRENTLY CONFIGURED PROFILE
Selected Profile,MIN TL-XH 3000-10000
Selected Profile Key,min_tl_xh_3000_10000_v201

DETECTION ANALYSIS
Detected Model,MOD Series 6000-15000TL3-XH
Suggested Profile Key,mod_6000_15000tl3_xh
```

This makes it clear:

- ✅ What profile you have configured and are currently using
- ✅ What profile the auto-detection suggests
- ✅ Whether there's a mismatch between selected and detected

#### 2. Current Entity Values Section

The register scan now includes a comprehensive snapshot of all current entity values from Home Assistant:

```csv
CURRENT ENTITY VALUES FROM INTEGRATION
Entity Name,Current Value
ac_current,5.234
ac_frequency,50.020
ac_power,1234.567
ac_voltage,230.123
battery_charge_power,0.000
battery_current,2.345
battery_power,567.890
battery_soc,85.000
battery_temp,None (unavailable)
battery_voltage,51.234
energy_today,12.345
grid_power,1234.567
house_consumption,567.890
pv1_current,6.789
pv1_power,1234.567
pv1_voltage,182.345
...
```

Features:

- ✅ Shows **all** entity values including zeros and unavailable
- ✅ Clearly marks unavailable values as "None (unavailable)"
- ✅ Alphabetically sorted for easy lookup
- ✅ Formatted for readability (floats to 3 decimals)

Benefits for debugging:

- Compare raw register values vs. processed entity values
- See complete snapshot of integration state at scan time
- Identify which values are zero vs. missing vs. unavailable
- Verify entity processing and calculations

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/diagnostic.py`:
  - Added imports for profile display name functions
  - Extract currently selected profile from coordinator
  - Extract all current entity values from coordinator data
  - Display both sections in CSV before detection analysis

### Migration Notes:

- **No action required** - Enhancement is automatic
- Works when register scan finds a matching integration (same connection)
- If no integration found, shows detection analysis only (as before)

# Release Notes - v0.5.3

## 🔧 Bug Fix - Missing Battery BMS Temperature Register (Issue #184)

This release fixes an issue where register 3136 (battery BMS temperature) was undefined in MOD and MIN TL-XH profiles, causing incorrect sensor values in Home Assistant.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** Users reported seeing duplicate/incorrect battery sensors:

- "Battery charging from mains power: **36.60 kWh**" (incorrect - actually a temperature!)
- "Boost Temperature: 0.0°C" (incorrect - register 95 reads 0)
- Missing battery BMS temperature sensor

**Root Cause:**

- Register 3136 was **not defined** in MOD 6000-15000TL3-XH and MIN TL-XH profiles
- Raw value: 366 (36.6 with ×0.1 scale)
- Integration misinterpreted this as **energy data** (36.60 kWh) instead of **temperature** (36.6°C)
- Register is in the 3000+ extended range used by both MOD and MIN profiles

**Additional Issue:**

- User had MIN 3000 TL-XH (single-phase) but auto-detection selected MOD profile (three-phase)
- Phase S/T registers all showed 0, confirming single-phase inverter
- Wrong profile caused incorrect register mappings and missing/duplicate sensors

**The Fix:**

Added missing battery BMS temperature register to both profiles:

1. **MOD 6000-15000TL3-XH Profile** (`profiles/mod.py`):

   - Register 96: `temp_sensor_1` (36.6°C - additional BMS/battery temperature)
   - Register 97: `temp_sensor_2` (32.7°C - matches Growatt server Boost Temp)
   - Register 3136: `battery_bms_temp` (36.6°C - battery BMS/module temperature)
2. **MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 Profile** (`profiles/tl_xh.py`):

   - Register 3136: `battery_bms_temp` (36.6°C - battery BMS/module temperature)

**Why Both Profiles:**

- Register 3136 is in the **3000+ extended range** shared by both MOD and MIN inverters
- Registers 96-97 are MOD-specific (0-124 base range, not used by MIN)
- Fix benefits both actual MOD users and users who should be using MIN profile

**Impact:**

- ✅ New sensor: "Battery BMS Temp" showing correct temperature (36.6°C)
- ✅ Removes incorrect "Battery charging from mains power: 36.60 kWh" sensor
- ✅ Properly identifies temperature vs energy data
- ✅ Fixes duplicate sensor issues for MOD/MIN TL-XH users

### 📋 Action Required:

**For users with MIN 3000 TL-XH inverters:**

1. **Update to v0.5.3**
2. **Reconfigure to correct profile:**

   - Go to: Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt
   - Click **Configure** on your inverter
   - Change profile to: **MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 (V2.01)**
   - Save and restart Home Assistant
3. **Verify after restart:**

   - ✅ "Battery BMS Temp" sensor appears (~36.6°C)
   - ❌ Incorrect "36.60 kWh" sensor removed
   - ✅ Battery power sensors still work correctly
   - ✅ Three-phase sensors (Phase S/T) hidden

**For users with actual MOD inverters:**

- Simply update to v0.5.3 and restart
- New temperature sensors will appear automatically

### Technical Details:

**Register Analysis from Scan (2026-03-09 14:12:43):**

- Register 96 (base range): 366 raw = 36.6°C
- Register 97 (base range): 327 raw = 32.7°C (matches Growatt server)
- Register 3136 (extended): 366 raw = 36.6°C
- Battery charging: 2.14kW (Growatt server), 1626W (register 3181) ✓ correct
- Phase S/T registers: All 0 → Single-phase → MIN profile needed

**Files Changed:**

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/mod.py` (lines 77-78, 123)
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/tl_xh.py` (line 312)

**Affected Models:**

- MOD 6000-15000TL3-XH (three-phase hybrid)
- MIN TL-XH 3000-10000 (single-phase hybrid)
- Any inverter using these profiles with battery BMS temperature at register 3136

**Detection Improvement Needed:**

- Auto-detection currently selects MOD for MIN inverters
- Future improvement: Check phase S/T registers to distinguish single vs three-phase

# Release Notes - v0.5.2

## 🔧 Critical Bug Fix - Integration Initialization Failure (Issue #188)

This release fixes a critical bug where the integration fails to initialize on inverters that don't support extended register ranges added in v0.5.0.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** After upgrading to v0.5.*, some users reported:

- Integration stuck in "Initializing" state with constant retrying
- Error in logs: `ExceptionResponse(dev_id=1, function_code=132, exception_code=4)`
- Error message: `Modbus error reading input registers 3000-3078`
- Downgrading to v0.4.8 resolves the issue

**Root Cause:**

- In v0.5.0, registers 3071-3078 were added to SPH V2.01 profiles for load energy and grid export energy metrics
- These registers are in the MIN/MOD range (3000-3124) which not all inverters support
- When reading the 3000 range, inverters without these registers return Modbus exception code 4 (Slave Device Failure)
- The code treated this as a **fatal error** and aborted initialization by returning `None`
- This was inconsistent with how other register ranges (storage 1000-1124, business 875-999) handle failures

**The Fix:**

Changed 3000 range register read failure handling from fatal to graceful degradation:

1. **Non-Fatal Error Handling:**

   - Changed from `logger.error()` + `return None` to `logger.warning()` + continue
   - Matches the pattern used for storage and business register ranges
   - Allows initialization to complete even if extended registers aren't available
2. **Graceful Degradation:**

   - Inverters **with** extended registers: Get full data including load energy metrics
   - Inverters **without** extended registers: Work normally with core functionality
   - No user intervention required - automatic compatibility

**Impact:**

- ✅ Integration initializes successfully on all inverter models
- ✅ Fixes "stuck in Initializing" issue reported in #188
- ✅ Backward compatible with inverters lacking extended register support
- ✅ Forward compatible - still provides enhanced data when registers are available
- ✅ No configuration changes needed

### 📋 Action Required:

**For users experiencing initialization failures:**

1. **Update to v0.5.2**
2. **Restart Home Assistant**
3. **Verify integration initializes successfully:**
   - Integration should complete initialization within 30 seconds
   - No more "Initializing" stuck state
   - All supported sensors should appear and update normally

**No configuration changes needed** - fix is automatic after upgrade.

### Technical Details:

**Files Changed:**

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/growatt_modbus.py:824-825`

**What Changed:**

- Modified `_read_registers()` method to handle 3000 range read failures gracefully
- Changed error handling from fatal (return None) to warning (continue)
- Inverters report Modbus exception code 4 when unsupported registers are requested
- Integration now continues with available data instead of aborting

**Affected Models:**

- All inverter models that don't support registers 3071-3078 (load energy, grid export in MIN/MOD range)
- Primarily affects inverters without VPP V2.01 protocol extended register support
- Fixes compatibility regression introduced in v0.5.0

## 🚀 Enhancement - MIC Auto-Detection Fix for Waveshare Adapters (Issue #187)

This release fixes auto-detection timeouts for MIC micro inverters when using Waveshare RS485-to-ETH adapters.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** MIC 3000TLX users with Waveshare RS485-ETH adapters reported:

- Integration hangs at "off-grid inverter warning" screen during setup
- Setup takes ~10 minutes instead of completing immediately
- Logs show: `No response received after 3 retries` when reading register 30000
- Integration eventually times out and fails to initialize

**Root Cause:**

- MIC micro inverters use **legacy V3.05 protocol** (registers 0-179 only)
- Auto-detection was attempting to read VPP 2.01 register 30000 before checking legacy registers
- MIC doesn't support register 30000, causing long timeout with Waveshare adapters
- Legacy register detection (which includes MIC) only ran AFTER the VPP timeout

**The Fix:**

Added **early legacy register detection** before attempting VPP register reads:

1. **Quick Legacy Check (Step 1.5):**

   - Try reading register 3 (PV1 voltage) - exists in most legacy protocols
   - If register 3 responds, check if register 3003 is absent
   - Register 3 present + register 3003 absent = MIC series (0-179 range only)
2. **Skip VPP Detection:**

   - Once MIC is detected via legacy registers, skip reading register 30000
   - Prevents long timeout on unsupported VPP registers
   - Detection completes in <1 second instead of ~10 minutes
3. **Detection Order Updated:**

   - Step 1: OffGrid DTC (registers 34/43) - SPF detection
   - **Step 1.5: Legacy register check (NEW) - MIC detection**
   - Step 2: VPP DTC (register 30000) - V2.01 inverters
   - Step 3: Model name read
   - Step 4: Register probing (fallback)

**Impact:**

- ✅ MIC inverters detected immediately via legacy registers
- ✅ No timeout on unsupported VPP register 30000
- ✅ Setup completes in <1 second instead of ~10 minutes
- ✅ Works with all RS485-to-TCP adapters including Waveshare
- ✅ No impact on other inverter models

### 📋 Waveshare RS485-to-ETH Configuration

For users with Waveshare RS485-to-ETH adapters, use these settings:

**Connection Parameters:**

- **Baud Rate:** 9600
- **Data Bits:** 8
- **Parity:** None
- **Stop Bits:** 1
- **Port:** 502 (Modbus TCP standard)
- **Reset:** Off
- **Link:** On
- **Index:** Off
- **RFC2217 (Similar):** On

These settings are now documented in the README for reference.

### Technical Details:

**Files Changed:**

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/auto_detection.py:923-945`
- `README.md:118-131` (added Waveshare configuration guide)

**Detection Logic:**

```python
# Before: VPP DTC read first → timeout on MIC
1. OffGrid DTC → VPP DTC → Model name → Register probing

# After: Legacy check before VPP → instant MIC detection
1. OffGrid DTC → Legacy check (MIC) → VPP DTC → Model name → Register probing
```

**Affected Models:**

- MIC 600-3300TL-X series (all micro inverters using 0-179 register range)
- Any legacy inverter using V3.05 protocol without VPP 2.01 support
- Particularly affects users with Waveshare RS485-to-ETH adapters

# Release Notes - v0.5.1

## 🔧 Bug Fixes - SPH Battery & Grid Energy Sensors

This release fixes critical sensor issues for SPH inverters including battery sensor inaccuracies and grid energy calculation errors.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** SPH 3-6kW V2.01 users reporting incorrect battery sensor values (Issue #185):

- Battery SOC showing 0% instead of actual value (e.g., 31%)
- AC Charge Energy Total showing garbage value (70,516,736 kWh)
- Battery charge/discharge energy sensors showing incorrect or missing values

**Root Cause:**

- Register 17 (inherited from base profile) returns 0 for SOC on V2.01 inverters
- Correct SOC value is available in register 1086 (BMS register) but wasn't configured
- Battery energy registers in VPP range (31202-31209) were incorrectly mapped
- AC Charge Energy Total used wrong 32-bit register pairing (31220-31221)

**The Fix:**

1. **Added Correct Battery SOC Register:**

   - Added register 1086 for `battery_soc` in SPH 3-6kW V2.01 profile
   - Overrides inherited register 17 which returns 0
   - Provides accurate SOC value directly from BMS
2. **Fixed Battery Energy Register Mappings:**

   - Changed registers 31202-31203 from power to discharge_today energy
   - Added registers 31204-31205 for battery_charge_total
   - Added registers 31206-31207 for battery_charge_today
   - Added registers 31208-31209 for battery_discharge_total
   - All battery energy tracking now accurate
3. **Fixed AC Charge Energy Total:**

   - Added register 115 for `ac_charge_energy_total`
   - Prevents garbage value of 70,516,736 kWh

**Impact:**

- ✅ Battery SOC now shows correct value (e.g., 31% instead of 0%)
- ✅ AC Charge Energy Total shows realistic value (e.g., 7.8 kWh instead of 70M kWh)
- ✅ Battery charge/discharge energy sensors now accurate
- ✅ Complete battery monitoring for SPH 3-6kW V2.01 users

## 🔧 Bug Fix - SPH-TL3 Grid Import Energy Calculation (Issue #183)

This release fixes incorrect grid import energy values for SPH-TL3 inverters where the energy sensor would show decreasing values or incorrect totals.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** SPH-TL3 users reporting incorrect grid import energy:

- Grid import energy showing values that decrease when solar production starts
- Calculated values significantly different from actual grid consumption
- Energy meters not reflecting true grid import

**Root Cause:**

- SPH-TL3 has hardware registers for grid import energy (energy_to_user_today at 1044-1045 and energy_to_user_total at 1046-1047)
- Code was checking for energy_from_grid_today/total which don't exist on SPH-TL3
- This caused fallback to calculation: `import = load - solar + export`
- Calculation was **incorrect for hybrid inverters** because `solar` (energy_today) includes both PV generation AND battery discharge
- When solar production increased, calculated import energy would decrease (mathematically incorrect)

**The Fix:**

Modified sensor.py to check for energy_to_user_today/total registers and use them directly when available:

1. **Added Hardware Register Support:**

   - Check for registers 1044-1045 (`energy_to_user_today`) for daily grid import
   - Check for registers 1046-1047 (`energy_to_user_total`) for total grid import
   - Use hardware meter readings directly instead of calculation
2. **Improved CT Clamp Handling:**

   - Normal orientation + hardware register: use energy_to_user directly
   - CT clamp backwards + hardware register: use energy_to_grid (swapped)
   - No hardware register available: fall back to calculation (MIN series, etc.)
3. **Accurate Grid Import Tracking:**

   - Values now come directly from hardware meter
   - No dependency on PV production or battery discharge calculations
   - Grid import energy never decreases incorrectly

**Impact:**

- ✅ SPH-TL3 grid import energy now accurate from hardware registers
- ✅ Values stable and don't decrease when solar production starts
- ✅ Proper handling of CT clamp orientation (normal vs backwards)
- ✅ Fallback calculation still works for inverters without hardware registers
- ✅ Fixes issue #183

### 📋 Action Required for SPH Users:

**For SPH 3-6kW V2.01 inverters:**

1. **Update to v0.5.1**
2. **Restart Home Assistant**
3. **Verify sensors show correct values:**
   - Battery SOC should show actual percentage (not 0%)
   - AC Charge Energy Total should be realistic (not millions of kWh)
   - Battery energy today/total sensors should update properly

**For SPH-TL3 inverters:**

1. **Update to v0.5.1**
2. **Restart Home Assistant**
3. **Verify grid import energy:**
   - Grid import energy should be stable and accurate
   - Values should not decrease when solar production increases
   - Energy readings should match your actual grid consumption

**No configuration changes needed** - fixes are automatic after upgrade.

### Technical Details:

**Files Changed:**

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/sph.py` (SPH 3-6kW battery sensors)
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/sensor.py` (SPH-TL3 grid energy calculation)

**SPH 3-6kW Battery Fix - Registers Added/Modified:**

- 1086: `battery_soc` (overrides register 17)
- 115: `ac_charge_energy_total` (replaces incorrect 31220-31221 pair)
- 31202-31203: `battery_discharge_today` (was incorrectly mapped as power)
- 31204-31205: `battery_charge_total` (newly added)
- 31206-31207: `battery_charge_today` (newly added)
- 31208-31209: `battery_discharge_total` (newly added)

**SPH-TL3 Grid Energy Fix - Registers Used:**

- 1044-1045: `energy_to_user_today` (daily grid import from hardware meter)
- 1046-1047: `energy_to_user_total` (total grid import from hardware meter)
- Fallback calculation for inverters without hardware registers (MIN series, etc.)

**Affected Models:**

- **Battery sensor fix:** SPH 3000-6000 (V2.01 protocol only)
- **Grid energy fix:** SPH-TL3 (all versions with hardware meter registers)
- Does not affect SPH 7-10kW or other SPH models

## ⚠️ Known Issue - MIC-1000TL-X Profile Selection (Issue #130)

Some MIC-1000TL-X inverters (firmware "PV 1000") may show zero values for AC power, energy today, energy total, AC current, and AC frequency when using the "MIC 600-3300TL-X (V2.01)" profile.

### Problem:

MIC-1000TL-X inverters can have **two different register layouts**:

1. **Standard layout** (0-179 range): AC data at registers 11-12, 26-27
2. **Hybrid MIN layout** (0-124 + 3000-3124 range): AC data at registers 3028-3029, 3049-3050

If you selected "MIC 600-3300TL-X (V2.01)" but your inverter uses the hybrid MIN layout, the integration will read the wrong registers and show zeros.

### Solution:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations**
2. Find your **Growatt Modbus** integration
3. Click **Configure**
4. Change **Inverter Series** to: **MIC 1000-6000TL-X (MIN range)**
5. Click **Submit**
6. Restart Home Assistant

After restart, all sensors should show correct values.

### How to Identify if You Need This:

- **Inverter model:** MIC-1000TL-X (or similar MIC models 1-3.3kW)
- **Firmware:** "PV 1000" or similar
- **Symptoms:** AC power = 0, Energy today = 0, but PV power shows correct values
- **Profile needed:** MIC 1000-6000TL-X (MIN range)

**Note:** The profile name says "1000-6000" but works for all MIC inverters (including MIC-1000TL-X) that use the hybrid MIN register layout. The auto-detection should select this automatically, but if you manually selected a profile, you may need to change it.

# Release Notes - v0.5.0

## 🔧 Critical Bug Fix - Diagnostic DTC Detection

This release fixes a critical bug in the diagnostic scanner that caused incorrect profile suggestions for VPP 2.01 inverters.

### What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** Diagnostic scanner incorrectly overriding DTC-based detection with register-based detection:

- DTC code would correctly identify inverter model (e.g., DTC 3501 = SPH 3-6kW)
- Register-based detection would then override with wrong model (e.g., SPH 8-10kW HU)
- Users ended up with wrong profile selection, causing missing or incorrect sensors

**Root Cause:**

- Diagnostic scanner performed DTC detection first
- Then continued to register-based detection logic
- Register-based detection would override correct DTC mapping
- Example: SPH 3-6kW V2.01 has storage range (1000+) which triggered HU detection

**The Fix:**

- Added early exit after successful DTC detection
- Register-based detection now only runs if DTC detection fails
- DTC detection takes priority as most reliable method

**Impact:**

- ✅ DTC 3501 (SPH 3-6kW) now correctly suggests `sph_3000_6000_v201` instead of `sph_8000_10000_hu`
- ✅ All VPP 2.01 inverters with valid DTC codes get correct profile suggestions
- ✅ Battery sensors work correctly with proper profile

### 📋 Action Required for Existing Users:

If you previously ran the diagnostic scanner and it suggested the **wrong profile**, you need to update your configuration:

**Symptoms of wrong profile:**

- Missing battery sensors
- Incorrect power readings
- Diagnostic showed different model than what you selected

**How to Fix:**

1. **Update to v0.5.0**
2. **Re-run diagnostic scanner** (it will now show correct profile)
3. **Update your integration configuration:**
   - Go to: **Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations**
   - Find **Growatt Modbus** integration
   - Click **Configure**
   - Change **Inverter Series** to match diagnostic suggestion
   - Click **Submit**
4. **Restart Home Assistant**

**Common Corrections:**

- DTC 3501/3502: Change from `SPH 8-10kW HU` → `SPH 3-6kW (V2.01)`
- DTC 3501/3502: Change from `SPH 7-10kW` → `SPH 3-6kW (V2.01)`

### Technical Details:

**File Changed:** `diagnostic.py`

**Code Added:**

```python
# If DTC detected model, skip other detection logic
if detection["confidence"] == "Very High":
    return detection
```

This ensures DTC-based detection (confidence = "Very High") takes priority and prevents register-based detection from overriding the correct profile.

**Affected DTC Codes:**

- 3501, 3502, 3735 (SPH/SPA 3-6kW)
- 3601, 3725 (SPH/SPA TL3)
- 5100 (TL-XH)
- 5200, 5201 (MIN/MIC)
- 5400 (MOD-XH/MID-XH)
- 5603, 5601, 5800 (WIT/WIS)

**Fixed:**

- Battery power sign inversion for VPP protocol registers (1013-1014 swapped)
- Missing energy and battery registers in SPH V2.01 profiles (Issue #176)
- Multiple inverters on same IP rejected with "already configured" (Issue #179)
- SPH TL3 Energy Today showing AC output instead of PV production (Issue #172)

**Added:**

- Multi-register write support for advanced Modbus operations

- Grid power sensor improvement using power_to_user register (PR #170)
- Register scan now includes holding registers in CSV output
- New `get_register_data` service for programmatic register reads

---

## What's New in v0.4.9:

### 1. 🔋 Fixed Battery Power Sign for VPP Protocol Registers

**Problem:** VPP protocol inverters (WIT, SPH V2.01) showing inverted battery power signs:

- Battery charging (power should be positive) showed negative values
- Battery discharging (power should be negative) showed positive values
- Caused confusion in energy monitoring and automation

**Root Cause:**

- VPP protocol stores battery power in registers 1013-1014 in **swapped order**
- Register 1013: Low word (W)
- Register 1014: High word (kW)
- Integration was reading them as 1014+1013 (reversed), causing sign inversion

**The Fix:**

- Registers 1013-1014 now read in correct order for VPP protocol profiles
- Battery power signs now match physical behavior:
  - **Positive = Charging** (power going INTO battery)
  - **Negative = Discharging** (power coming OUT of battery)
- Affects: WIT, SPH V2.01, and other VPP protocol inverters

**Impact:**

- ✅ Battery power values now show correct sign
- ✅ Automation triggers work as expected
- ✅ Energy flow visualization accurate

### 2. 🔋 Added Missing Registers to SPH V2.01 Profiles (Issue #176)

**Added to SPH V2.01:**

- Battery registers: SOC, voltage, current, power, temperature, discharge limits
- Energy registers: Battery charge/discharge energy (today & total)
- Complete battery monitoring for SPH inverters using VPP protocol

**Impact:**

- ✅ SPH V2.01 users now have full battery monitoring
- ✅ Battery charge/discharge energy tracking available
- ✅ Complete parity with SPH TL3 legacy profile features

### 3. 🔧 Fixed Unique ID Collision for Multiple Inverters (Issue #179)

**Problem:** Multiple inverters on same IP (different ports) could not be configured:

- Common with Modbus proxy/gateway setups
- Second inverter rejected: "This inverter is already configured"

**Root Cause:**

- TCP unique ID format was: `{host}_{slave_id}` (ignored port number)
- Multiple inverters on same IP with different ports generated identical unique IDs

**The Fix:**

- Changed TCP unique ID format to: `{host}:{port}_{slave_id}`
- Example: `192.168.168.4:5021_1` vs `192.168.168.4:5022_1`

**Impact:**

- ✅ Multiple inverters on same IP with different ports now supported
- ✅ Modbus proxy/gateway setups work correctly
- ✅ Still prevents true duplicates (same IP+port+slave_id)

### 4. 🔧 Fixed SPH TL3 Energy Today (Issue #172)

**Problem:** SPH TL3 "Energy Today" showing AC output instead of true PV production:

- DC-coupled battery charging excluded from total
- Reported values significantly lower than actual solar production

**The Fix:**

- Added per-MPPT PV energy registers (59-60, 63-64, 91-92) to SPH TL3 profile
- Energy Today now calculated as: **PV1 + PV2** (true solar production)
- Same fix previously applied to WIT profile in v0.4.7

**Impact:**

- ✅ Energy Today shows accurate total PV production
- ✅ Values include DC-coupled battery charging
- ✅ Consistent with WIT behavior

### 5. ✨ Multi-Register Write Support (PR #168)

**Added:** Ability to write multiple registers in a single Modbus transaction

- New `write_multiple_registers` method in GrowattModbus class

- Advanced inverter programming

### 6. 🎯 WIT VPP Battery Control Enhancements (PR #171)

**Added:**

- WIT VPP battery control entities (charge/discharge power, duration)
- Service handlers for programmatic battery control
- Remote control enable/disable functionality
- Integration with VPP protocol time-limited overrides

**New Entities:**

- Remote Power Control Enable (register 30407)
- Remote Charging Time (register 30408, duration in minutes)
- Remote Charge/Discharge Power (register 30409, -100% to +100%)

### 7. 🎯 WIT VPP Export Limitation (PR #175)

**Added:**

- VPP export limitation control registers (30200/30201)
- Enable/disable export limiting
- Set maximum export power to grid

**Use Cases:**

# Release Notes - v0.4.9b4 (Pre-Release)

## 🔧 Bug Fix - Multiple Inverters on Same IP

**Fixed (Issue #179):**

- Multiple inverters on the same IP address (different ports) could not be configured
- Integration rejected second inverter with "This inverter is already configured"
- Common scenario with Modbus proxies/gateways exposing multiple inverters

---

### What's Fixed in v0.4.9b4:

#### 🔧 Fixed Unique ID Collision for Same-IP Multi-Inverter Setups (Issue #179)

**Problem:** Users with multiple inverters behind a Modbus proxy or gateway (same IP, different ports) could only configure one inverter. The second would fail with "This inverter is already configured."

**Root Cause:**

- TCP unique ID format was: `{host}_{slave_id}`
- Ignored the port number completely
- Multiple inverters on same IP with different ports generated identical unique IDs

**User Case (Issue #179):**

- Setup: 2 inverters → Waveshare → evcc → ModbusProxy
- SPH 10k TL3 BH-UP: `192.168.168.4:5021` (slave 1)
- MOD 10k TL3-XH: `192.168.168.4:5022` (slave 1)
- Both generated unique_id: `192.168.168.4_1` ❌ **COLLISION!**
- Only first inverter could be added

**The Fix:**

Changed TCP unique ID format to include port number:

- **Old format:** `{host}_{slave_id}` (e.g., `192.168.168.4_1`)
- **New format:** `{host}:{port}_{slave_id}` (e.g., `192.168.168.4:5021_1`)

**Impact:**

- ✅ Multiple inverters on same IP with different ports now supported
- ✅ Common Modbus proxy/gateway setups now work correctly
- ✅ Still prevents true duplicates (same IP+port+slave_id)
- ✅ Serial connections unchanged

**Example - Now Works:**

```
Configuration:
  SPH 10k TL3:  192.168.168.4:5021 slave_id=1 → unique_id: 192.168.168.4:5021_1 ✅
  MOD 10k TL3:  192.168.168.4:5022 slave_id=1 → unique_id: 192.168.168.4:5022_1 ✅

Still Blocks Duplicates:
  First:   192.168.168.4:502 slave_id=1 → unique_id: 192.168.168.4:502_1 ✅ (allowed)
  Second:  192.168.168.4:502 slave_id=1 → unique_id: 192.168.168.4:502_1 ❌ (blocked - true duplicate)
```

---

### Migration Notes:

**No action required for existing single-inverter setups** - unique IDs will update automatically.

**For Multi-Inverter Setups (Issue #179):**

- If you previously couldn't add a second inverter on the same IP:
  1. Upgrade to v0.4.9b4
  2. Try adding the second inverter again
  3. Both inverters will now configure successfully

**Technical Note:**

- Existing integrations will get new unique IDs on next restart
- Home Assistant handles unique ID changes automatically
- No need to remove/re-add existing integrations

---

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/config_flow.py` - Updated TCP unique_id format to include port
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/manifest.json` - Version bump to 0.4.9b4
- `README.md` - Version badge updated to 0.4.9b4
- `RELEASENOTES.md` - Updated with v0.4.9b4 changes

# Release Notes - v0.4.9b3 (Pre-Release)

## 🔧 Bug Fix - SPH TL3 Energy Today Incorrect Values

**Fixed (Issue #172):**

- SPH TL3 "Energy Today" sensor showing AC output energy instead of true PV solar production
- On hybrid inverters with batteries, DC-coupled battery charging was excluded from the total

---

### What's Fixed in v0.4.9b3:

#### 🔧 Fixed SPH TL3 Energy Today Calculation (Issue #172)

**Problem:** SPH TL3 users reported "Energy Today" showing significantly lower values than actual solar production. For example, a user producing ~8.1 kWh saw only 1.5-2.6 kWh reported.

**Root Cause:**

- Registers 53-54 (`energy_today`) on SPH TL3 measure **total AC output energy** (what goes to grid/loads)
- On hybrid inverters with batteries, energy that goes directly from PV to battery via DC coupling **bypasses the AC side** and is NOT counted in registers 53-54
- This means the "Energy Today" sensor was underreporting by the amount of DC-coupled battery charging

**User Case:**

- SPH TL3 inverter with battery
- Register 54 = 15 → 1.5 kWh (AC output only)
- Registers 60 (PV1) + 64 (PV2) = actual total PV production (~8.1 kWh)
- Difference = energy going directly to battery via DC coupling

**The Fix:**

1. **Added Per-MPPT PV Energy Registers to SPH TL3 Profile:**

   - 59-60: `pv1_energy_today` (PV string 1 DC energy production)
   - 63-64: `pv2_energy_today` (PV string 2 DC energy production)
   - 91-92: `pv_energy_total` (lifetime total PV energy from all MPPTs)
2. **Automatic Calculation:**

   - Existing code already sums PV1 + PV2 when per-MPPT registers are available
   - `energy_today` now calculated as: **PV1 + PV2** (true solar production)
   - Same approach already working correctly for WIT profile (Issue #146 fix in v0.4.7)

**Impact:**

- Energy Today now shows accurate total PV production (DC input from solar panels)
- Values include energy going to battery via DC coupling (previously excluded)
- Energy Total (lifetime) now uses PV energy total register for accuracy
- Other inverter profiles unaffected (backwards compatible)

**Example - Before vs After:**

```
Before (v0.4.9b1):
  Energy Today: 1.5 kWh  (AC output only, missing DC battery charging)

After (v0.4.9b3):
  Energy Today: 8.1 kWh  (PV1 + PV2 = true solar production)
```

---

### Migration Notes:

**No action required** - Fix is automatic after upgrade.

**For SPH TL3 Users:**

- "Energy Today" will now show higher (correct) values that include DC battery charging
- Dashboard energy graphs may show a one-time step change after upgrade - this is expected
- Previous values excluded DC-coupled battery charging (incorrect), new values are PV-only production (correct)

---

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/sph_tl3.py` - Added per-MPPT PV energy registers (59-60, 63-64, 91-92)
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/manifest.json` - Version bump to 0.4.9b3
- `README.md` - Version badge updated to 0.4.9b3

# Release Notes - v0.4.8

## 🔧 Bug Fix - MIC-1000TL-X Auto-Detection

**Fixed (Issue #130):**

- MIC-1000TL-X inverters incorrectly auto-detected as MIN series
- Manual MIC profile selection showed incorrect/missing values

---

### What's Fixed in v0.4.8:

#### 🔍 Improved MIC vs MIN Detection (Issue #130)

**Problem:**

- DTC code 5200 is shared by both MIC and MIN inverter series
- Previous logic tested for 3000+ register range to distinguish models
- Some MIC-1000TL-X inverters use MIN register layout (hybrid design) but are physically MIC hardware
- This caused incorrect auto-detection and wrong sensor values

**Root Cause:**

- MIC-1000TL-X (2500-6000W range) can use either:
  - Standard MIC layout: 0-179 registers only
  - Hybrid layout: 0-124 + 3000-3124 (MIN addressing) BUT with MIC features
- Previous detection tested register 3003 (MIN PV1 voltage)
- If found → assumed MIN series ❌
- If not found → assumed MIC series ✅

**User Case:**

- MIC-1000TL-X with firmware "PV 1000"
- Has data in BOTH 0-124 AND 3000-3124 ranges (hybrid layout)
- Previous detection saw 3000+ range → incorrectly selected MIN profile
- MIN profile missing MIC-specific per-MPPT energy registers (59-62)
- Result: Wrong/missing sensor values

**The Fix:**

1. **Hardware-Level Detection:**

   - MIC inverters have per-MPPT energy tracking capability (registers 59-62)
   - MIN inverters do NOT have these registers (not a firmware feature - hardware difference)
   - Now test registers 59-62 FIRST before checking register range
2. **New Detection Logic for DTC 5200:**

   ```
   Step 1: Read registers 59-62 (PV1/PV2 per-MPPT energy)

   Step 2: Validate if values are plausible energy data:
           - MIC hardware: registers contain valid energy values (high word 0-100)
           - MIN hardware: registers return garbage/system values (e.g., 5200 = DTC code)
           - Check: high word < 100 (rejects invalid data like DTC codes)

   Step 3: If valid energy data found in registers 59-62:
           → MIC hardware detected
           → Check if uses MIN layout (3000+ range)
           → If yes: Use new MIC_2500_6000TL_X_MIN_RANGE profile
           → If no: Use standard MIC_600_3300TL_X_V201 profile

   Step 4: If registers 59-62 empty or invalid:
           → MIN hardware (no per-MPPT capability or garbage data)
           → Use MIN_3000_6000TL_X_V201 profile
   ```
3. **New MIC Profile Created:**

   - Profile: `MIC_2500_6000TL_X_MIN_RANGE`
   - Supports hybrid MIC inverters using MIN register addressing
   - Combines:
     - MIN 0-124 register range (basic data)
     - MIN 3000-3124 register range (AC power, energy)
     - MIC per-MPPT registers 59-62 (PV1/PV2 energy tracking)
   - Provides complete sensor coverage for these hybrid models

**Impact:**

- ✅ MIC-1000TL-X correctly auto-detected regardless of register layout
- ✅ All sensors show correct values
- ✅ Per-MPPT energy tracking available for MIC users
- ✅ MIN detection unaffected (backwards compatible)
- ✅ Reliable hardware-level differentiation (not just register addressing)

**Example - Before vs After:**

```
Before (v0.4.7):
  Auto-Detection: MIN 3000-6000TL-X ❌ (wrong - saw 3000+ range)
  AC Power: 1127 W ✅ (worked from 3000+ range)
  Energy Today: 0.1 kWh ❌ (wrong - MIN profile missing PV1/PV2 registers)
  PV1 Energy: Not available ❌ (MIN profile doesn't define register 59-60)

After (v0.4.8):
  Auto-Detection: MIC 2500-6000TL-X (MIN range) ✅ (correct - saw registers 59-62)
  AC Power: 1127 W ✅ (from 3000+ range)
  Energy Today: 0.1 kWh ✅ (correct - using per-MPPT registers)
  PV1 Energy: 0.1 kWh ✅ (now available from register 59-60)
  PV2 Energy: 44927.0 kWh ✅ (now available from register 61-62)
```

---

### Technical Details:

**Register Scan Analysis:**

```
MIC-1000TL-X Hybrid Layout (verified):
  Register 11-12: 0 (MIC AC power location - empty)
  Register 35-36: 1127 (output power - populated)
  Register 59-60: 1/1 (PV1 energy - VALID energy data ✅)
  Register 61-62: 44927/0 (PV2 energy - VALID energy data ✅)
  Register 3028-3029: 1127 (MIN AC power location - populated)
  Register 3049-3052: energy values (MIN location - populated)

MIN 3000-6000TL-X (verified):
  Register 59: 5200 (garbage/DTC code - INVALID for energy ❌)
  Register 59-62: Returns system values, not energy data
  → Detection rejects high word >= 100 as garbage
```

**Validation Logic:**

- Energy registers use 32-bit pairs (high word, low word)
- Valid daily energy: 0-50 kWh → high word typically 0-1
- Valid lifetime energy: 10,000 kWh → high word ~1-2
- **Threshold: high word must be < 100 to be valid energy**
- MIN garbage values (5200, DTC codes, etc.) correctly rejected

**Key Insight:** Registers 59-62 differentiate MIC/MIN at hardware level. MIN may respond to these registers but returns garbage/system values, not energy data.

---

### Migration Notes:

**No action required** - Auto-detection improvement only.

**For Affected MIC-1000TL-X Users (Issue #130):**

- If previously manually selected MIN profile as workaround:
  1. Remove integration
  2. Re-add integration with auto-detection
  3. Inverter will now correctly detect as MIC
  4. All sensors (including per-MPPT energy) will appear

**Detection Changes:**

- MIC inverters with hybrid layout now correctly identified
- All existing MIC and MIN inverters unaffected
- More robust detection using hardware capabilities instead of register addressing

---

# Release Notes - v0.4.7

## 🐛 Bug Fix + 📊 Diagnostic Enhancement

**Fixed (Issue #146):**

- WIT "Energy Today" sensor showing incorrect values (total system output instead of PV-only production)
- WIT "Energy Total" sensor not reflecting actual solar panel production

**Enhanced:**

- Register scan now includes firmware version in metadata output

---

### What's Fixed in v0.4.7:

#### 1. 🔧 Fixed WIT PV Energy Calculation (Issue #146)

**Problem:** WIT users reported "Energy Today" sensor increasing at night when no solar production occurring.

**Root Cause:**

- Registers 53-56 (energy_today/total) track **total system AC output** (PV + battery discharge combined)
- Not suitable for tracking solar production on hybrid inverters with batteries
- Values increase whenever battery powers loads, even at night

**User Report:**

- Register 56 showed 6.2 kWh (wrong - total system output)
- Register 60 (PV1): 4.8 kWh ✅
- Register 64 (PV2): 2.7 kWh ✅
- **Actual PV production: 4.8 + 2.7 = 7.5 kWh** ✅

**The Fix:**

1. **Added Missing Registers to WIT Profile:**

   - 59-60: PV1 Energy Today (per-MPPT tracking)
   - 63-64: PV2 Energy Today (per-MPPT tracking)
   - 91-92: PV Energy Total (lifetime DC input from all MPPTs)
2. **Added Dataclass Fields:**

   - `pv1_energy_today` - PV1 MPPT daily production
   - `pv2_energy_today` - PV2 MPPT daily production
   - `pv_energy_total` - Lifetime PV production
3. **Changed Energy Calculation for WIT:**

   - `energy_today` now calculated as: **PV1 + PV2** (true solar production)
   - `energy_total` now uses register 92 (total PV lifetime energy)
   - Fallback to original registers for non-WIT inverters (backwards compatible)

**Impact:**

- ✅ WIT "Energy Today" now shows accurate solar production (not total system output)
- ✅ Values only increase during daylight when panels are producing
- ✅ Correctly tracks DC input from solar panels only
- ✅ Other inverter series unaffected (backwards compatible)

**Example - Before vs After:**

```
Before (v0.4.6):
  Energy Today: 6.2 kWh  ❌ (total system including battery)

After (v0.4.7):
  Energy Today: 7.5 kWh  ✅ (PV1 4.8 + PV2 2.7 = actual solar)
```

#### 2. 📊 Register Scan Enhancement

**Added:** Firmware version now included in register scan metadata output.

**How it Works:**

- Reads holding registers 9-11 (firmware version, ASCII encoded)
- Decodes to human-readable version string
- Displays in both CSV metadata and notification message

**Example Output:**

```
DETECTION ANALYSIS
Detected Model: WIT 4-15kW Hybrid
Confidence: Very High
DTC Code: 10046
Protocol Version: V2.01
Firmware: GH1.0     <-- NEW
Suggested Profile: WIT_4000_15000TL3
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Easier troubleshooting - firmware version visible in scans
- ✅ Helps identify firmware-specific behaviors
- ✅ No additional user action required - automatic extraction

---

### Migration Notes:

**No action required** - This is a bug fix and enhancement release.

**For WIT Users:**

- "Energy Today" and "Energy Total" sensors will now show correct PV production values
- **IMPORTANT:** Values may differ from v0.4.6 - this is expected and correct
- Previous values included battery discharge (wrong), new values are PV-only (correct)
- Dashboard energy graphs may show a one-time step change after upgrade

**For All Users:**

- Next register scan will include firmware version automatically
- No changes needed to existing scans

---

# Release Notes - v0.4.6

## 🐛 Bug Fixes + 🎯 WIT Control Stability Improvements

**Fixed (Issue #163):**

- SPF AC Charge Energy Today/Total sensors showing 0.00 (should show same values as Battery Charge sensors)
- SPF AC Discharge Energy Today/Total sensors showing 0.00 (registers 64-67)
- Noisy WARNING log message for SPF users: "load_energy_today_low register not found"

**Improved (Issue #143):**

- WIT control stability - prevent oscillation and unstable battery behavior
- WIT control model clarified - VPP protocol vs Legacy protocol differences
- Rate limiting added to prevent rapid control changes
- Control conflict detection for TOU vs remote control scenarios

---

### What's Fixed in v0.4.6:

#### 1. 🔧 Fixed SPF AC Charge/Discharge Energy Sensors

**Root Cause:** SPF uses different register names than WIT for the same energy measurements, causing "AC Charge/Discharge Energy" sensors to show 0.00 even though the data exists.

**Register Name Differences:**

- **WIT:** Uses `ac_charge_energy_*` and `ac_discharge_energy_*` register names
- **SPF:** Uses `charge_energy_*` (56-59) and `ac_discharge_energy_*` (64-67) register names
- Same data, different naming convention

**Affected sensors (now fixed):**

- `ac_charge_energy_today` - Now populated from SPF's `charge_energy_today` (registers 56-57)
- `ac_charge_energy_total` - Now populated from SPF's `charge_energy_total` (registers 58-59)
- `ac_discharge_energy_today` - Now reads from registers 64-65
- `ac_discharge_energy_total` - Now reads from registers 66-67

**The Fix:**

1. **AC Charge Energy**: SPF now populates BOTH `charge_energy_*` AND `ac_charge_energy_*` fields from the same registers (56-59)
2. **AC Discharge Energy**: Added missing register reading code for registers 64-67
3. **WIT compatibility**: WIT-specific register names still work for WIT inverters

**Impact:**

- ✅ SPF users will now see actual values in ALL "AC Charge/Discharge Energy" sensors
- ✅ "AC Charge Energy" sensors will match "Battery Charge" sensors (same data source)
- ✅ "AC Discharge Energy" sensors will show battery → load energy flow
- ✅ Complete energy tracking for SPF 6000 ES Plus and similar models

**What You'll See After Upgrade (SPF users):**

- "Battery Charge Today" = 0.80 kWh ✅ (working before)
- "AC Charge Energy Today" = 0.80 kWh ✅ (NOW FIXED - was 0.00)
- "Battery Charge Total" = 446.90 kWh ✅ (working before)
- "AC Charge Energy Total" = 446.90 kWh ✅ (NOW FIXED - was 0.00)
- "AC Discharge Energy Today" = actual value ✅ (NOW FIXED - was 0.00)
- "AC Discharge Energy Total" = actual value ✅ (NOW FIXED - was 0.00)

**Note:** Both "Battery Charge" and "AC Charge Energy" sensors track the same thing (grid/generator charging your battery) and will show identical values. This is normal - they're just different sensor names for the same SPF register data.

#### 2. 🔇 Reduced Log Noise for Off-Grid Inverters

**Issue:** SPF users (and other off-grid models) saw constant WARNING messages in Home Assistant logs:

[SPF 3000-6000 ES PLUS@/dev/ttyACM0] load_energy_today_low register not found
**Root Cause:** The `load_energy_today` register is specific to **grid-tied inverters** (SPH/MIN/MID/MAX) that track energy consumed from grid by loads. **Off-grid inverters** like SPF don't have this register because they use different energy tracking:

- `ac_discharge_energy_*` - Battery → loads via inverter
- `op_discharge_energy_*` - Operational discharge energy

The code was logging this as a WARNING even though it's expected and harmless for off-grid models.

**The Fix:** Changed log level from WARNING to DEBUG with clarifying message: "register not found (expected for off-grid models like SPF)"

**Impact:**

- ✅ SPF users will no longer see noisy warnings in logs
- ✅ Debug logging still available if needed for troubleshooting
- ✅ No functional changes - purely cosmetic log improvement

#### 3. 🎯 WIT Control Stability Improvements (Issue #143)

**Problem:** WIT users experiencing power oscillation, charge/discharge looping, and unstable control behavior when using battery management features.

**Root Cause:** WIT inverters use **VPP (Virtual Power Plant) protocol** with fundamentally different control model:

- **WIT**: Time-limited overrides (NOT persistent mode changes like SPH/SPF)
- Register 30476 (`priority_mode`) is **READ-ONLY** on WIT - shows TOU default, cannot be changed via Modbus
- Proper control requires VPP remote registers (30407-30409) with duration-based commands
- Rapid control changes cause oscillation and conflicts with TOU schedules

**The Fixes:**

1. **Register 30476 Marked Read-Only**

   - WIT profile now correctly marks `priority_mode` (30476) as `'access': 'R'`
   - Prevents users from trying to write to read-only register
   - Description updated to clarify VPP control model
   - Users guided to use proper VPP remote control instead
2. **30-Second Rate Limiting**

   - All WIT control writes now have 30-second cooldown
   - Prevents rapid automation loops that cause oscillation
   - Applies to registers: 201, 202, 203, 30100, 30407, 30408, 30409
   - Warning logged if write blocked: "Rate limit: WIT control writes must be 30s apart"
   - Gives inverter time to respond and stabilize
3. **Control Conflict Detection**

   - Detects multiple VPP remote controls active simultaneously
   - Warns when TOU schedule conflicts with remote control
   - Logs warnings to Home Assistant logs
   - Helps users identify problematic automation patterns
4. **Comprehensive WIT Control Guide**

   - New documentation: `docs/WIT_CONTROL_GUIDE.md`
   - Explains VPP vs Legacy protocol differences
   - Shows proper WIT control patterns with examples
   - Documents why register 30476 is read-only
   - Provides automation templates for stable control
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

**Impact:**

- ✅ WIT users can now implement stable battery control
- ✅ Oscillation and looping behavior prevented
- ✅ Clear guidance on proper VPP remote control usage
- ✅ Automatic conflict detection helps debug issues
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents automation mistakes

**WIT Control Registers (Rate Limited):**

- 201: Active Power Rate (Legacy VPP)
- 202: Work Mode (Legacy VPP)
- 203: Export Limit (W)
- 30100: Control Authority (VPP master enable)
- 30407: Remote Power Control Enable
- 30408: Remote Charging Time (duration in minutes)
- 30409: Remote Charge/Discharge Power (-100% to +100%)

**For WIT Users:**

- **Read the guide**: See `docs/WIT_CONTROL_GUIDE.md` for proper control patterns
- **Use VPP remote control**: Don't try to write to register 30476
- **Set durations**: All overrides should specify time duration (register 30408)
- **Wait 30s between changes**: Rate limiting is intentional to prevent oscillation
- **Check for conflicts**: Monitor logs for TOU vs remote control warnings

---

### Migration Notes:

**No action required** - This is a bug fix and improvement release. Simply upgrade and:

- SPF AC Charge/Discharge Energy sensors will show correct values
- Log warnings for missing load_energy_today register will disappear
- WIT control writes will have automatic rate limiting

**For SPF users:**

- All four AC Charge/Discharge Energy sensors will now work
- "AC Charge Energy" sensors will show identical values to "Battery Charge" sensors (expected behavior)
- Log noise from missing grid-tied registers eliminated

**For WIT users:**

- **IMPORTANT:** Read `docs/WIT_CONTROL_GUIDE.md` if you use battery control features
- Control writes now have 30s cooldown (prevents oscillation - this is intentional)
- Register 30476 (priority_mode) is now correctly marked read-only
- If you have automations that write to WIT controls rapidly, they may need adjustment
- Check logs for rate limit warnings and control conflict warnings

**Debug logging setup** (optional, for troubleshooting):

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.growatt_modbus: debug
```
---

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/growatt_modbus.py` - Added AC charge/discharge energy register mapping for SPF + reduced log noise + WIT rate limiting + conflict detection

# Release Notes - v0.4.5

## 🔥 CRITICAL Bug Fix: Serial Connection File Descriptor Leak

**Fixed:**

- **CRITICAL:** Serial connection file descriptor leak causing permanent integration failure after overnight offline periods

---

### What's Fixed in v0.4.5:

#### 1. 🔥 CRITICAL: Fixed Serial Connection File Descriptor Leak

**Root Cause:** When using USB-RS485 adapters (serial connection), failed connection attempts during offline periods (e.g., overnight when inverter is powered down) were not properly releasing the serial port file descriptor. Over hours of offline polling, hundreds of leaked file descriptors would accumulate until the system exhausted its limit.

**Symptoms:**

- Integration works fine initially
- Inverter goes offline (night time, powered down)
- After several hours, integration stops working completely
- Error in logs: `OSError: [Errno 24] No file descriptors available`
- Integration never recovers even when inverter comes back online
- **Inverter is actually online** (proven by Growatt cloud connectivity)
- Only fix is restarting Home Assistant

**Technical Details:**
The coordinator's `_fetch_data()` method had three critical flaws:

1. **No cleanup on failed connection** - When `connect()` failed, `disconnect()` was never called to release the serial port
2. **No cleanup before retry** - Each retry attempt would call `connect()` without first calling `disconnect()`, potentially creating multiple open file descriptors
3. **Silent exception handling** - Bare `except: pass` blocks hid disconnect failures

**Scenario Example:**

- Inverter offline 5pm-5am (12 hours)
- Offline polling every 300s = ~144 poll attempts
- Each attempt tries 3 connection retries = ~432 connection attempts
- Each leaked file descriptor accumulates
- At 5:12am when inverter wakes: errno 24 "No file descriptors available"
- Integration permanently broken until HA restart

**The Fix:**

1. **Always disconnect before connect** - Ensures clean state, prevents double-open
2. **Always disconnect after failed connect** - Releases file descriptors even on failure
3. **Proper error logging** - Replace bare `except: pass` with debug logging
4. **Connection state checking** - Skip `connect()` if already connected (prevents double-open)

**Files Changed:**

- `coordinator.py:482-537` - Added disconnect calls before/after every connect attempt
- `growatt_modbus.py:330-350` - Added `is_socket_open()` check to prevent double-connect
- `growatt_modbus.py:351-364` - Enhanced disconnect error logging with critical error detection

**Impact:**

- ✅ **ALL Serial/USB-RS485 users (ALL inverter models):** Integration now properly recovers from overnight offline periods
- ✅ **TCP users:** Not affected by the bug, but benefits from cleaner connection management
- ✅ **All inverter series (MIN/MID/MAX/MOD/SPH/SPF/WIT/MIX/SPA):** No more permanent failures when using serial connections
- ✅ **Logging:** Better visibility into connection lifecycle and resource leak issues

**Migration Notes:**

- No action required - fix is automatic
- If you experienced this issue, upgrade to v0.4.5 and restart Home Assistant once
- Monitor logs after upgrade - should see `Disconnected successfully` debug messages
- If you see `CRITICAL: File descriptor leak detected!` in logs after upgrade, please report the issue

### Files Changed:

- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/coordinator.py` - Fixed file descriptor leak in _fetch_data()
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/growatt_modbus.py` - Enhanced connect/disconnect with leak prevention
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/manifest.json` - Version bump to 0.4.5
